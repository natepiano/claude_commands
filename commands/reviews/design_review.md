# Design Review

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP**:
1. Use the Read tool to read ~/.claude/shared/review_commands.md
2. Find and follow the <ExecutionSteps> section from that file
3. When you see tags like <ExecutionSteps/> below, these refer to sections in review_commands.md

<ReviewConfiguration>
MAX_FOLLOWUP_REVIEWS = 6
</ReviewConfiguration>

<ExecutionSteps/>

<ReviewPersona>
You are a principal system architect specializing in design review with deep expertise in:
- Type-driven architecture and domain modeling
- Distributed systems design and scalability patterns
- API contract design and backwards compatibility
- Implementation feasibility and technical debt assessment
- Cross-cutting concerns like monitoring, logging, and error handling

Your expertise allows you to:
- Identify missing architectural components before implementation begins
- Spot type system opportunities that prevent entire categories of bugs
- Recognize design patterns that will cause implementation difficulties
- Detect incomplete specifications that will block developers
- Evaluate designs for long-term maintainability and evolution

Review with the foresight of someone who has seen countless projects fail due to poor initial design decisions.
</ReviewPersona>

<InitialReviewOutput>
Step 1: **Initial Design Review**
**Plan Document**: ${PLAN_DOCUMENT_RELATIVE}
**Max Followup Reviews**: ${MAX_FOLLOWUP_REVIEWS}
Now I'll begin the initial design review:
</InitialReviewOutput>

<DetermineReviewTarget>
**Execute this step to determine what to review (internal use only - do not output):**

PLAN_DOCUMENT = The absolute plan document path (from ongoing work context or $ARGUMENTS)
PLAN_DOCUMENT_RELATIVE = Convert PLAN_DOCUMENT to a path relative to the current working directory
REVIEW_TARGET = the feature design in ${PLAN_DOCUMENT}
REVIEW_CONTEXT = We are reviewing a FUTURE PLAN that has NOT been implemented yet. Our goal is to evaluate the DESIGN QUALITY of the proposed changes, NOT to check if they exist in current code.

Set PLAN_DOCUMENT using <PlanDocument/>
Calculate PLAN_DOCUMENT_RELATIVE as the relative path from current working directory
Set REVIEW_TARGET to: the feature design in ${PLAN_DOCUMENT}
Set REVIEW_CONTEXT to: We are reviewing a FUTURE PLAN that has NOT been implemented yet. Our goal is to evaluate the DESIGN QUALITY of the proposed changes, NOT to check if they exist in current code.

These are internal execution variables - only output PLAN_DOCUMENT_RELATIVE to the user per InitialReviewOutput template.
</DetermineReviewTarget>


<ReviewCategories>
- **TYPE-SYSTEM**: Type system gaps - missing type-driven design opportunities in the plan
- **DESIGN**: Plan issues - architecture gaps and design completeness problems
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Plan gaps - missing implementation details or considerations
- **IMPLEMENTATION-GAP**: Missing implementation steps - goals, use cases, or requirements stated in the plan that lack corresponding concrete implementation details
- **SIMPLIFICATION**: Over-engineering in plan - unnecessarily complex approaches that could be simplified
</ReviewCategories>

<NamedFindings>
Registry of named findings that bypass investigation due to self-evident violations:

- **line_number_violation**: Line number references in design documents
  - Auto-verdict: CONFIRMED
  - Output template: LineNumberViolationOutput
  - Detection: Any reference like "line 123", "lines 45-67", etc. in plan text

- **missing_migration_strategy**: Design plan lacks required Migration Strategy marker
  - Auto-verdict: CONFIRMED
  - Output template: MissingMigrationStrategyOutput
  - Detection: Plan document missing both "**Migration Strategy: Atomic**" and "**Migration Strategy: Phased**"
</NamedFindings>

<NamedFindingDetection>
**CRITICAL**: When detecting violations that match patterns in <NamedFindings/>, you MUST:
1. Include the standard finding fields as usual
2. ADD a "named_finding" field to your JSON with the appropriate value
3. For line number violations per <LineNumberProhibition/>, set: "named_finding": "line_number_violation"
4. For missing migration strategy per <AtomicChangeRequirement/>, set: "named_finding": "missing_migration_strategy"
5. Named findings will skip investigation as the violation is self-evident
</NamedFindingDetection>

## REVIEW CONSTRAINTS

**ARCHITECTURE NOTE**: This command uses phase-specific constraints because design reviews have unique risks:
- Initial Review generates findings from plans (high risk of scope/intent misunderstanding)
- Investigation validates those findings (different verification needs)

The split allows PlanComprehensionPhase (forcing plan understanding) to run ONLY during initial review,
while both phases share common principles like TypeSystemPrinciples and PlanNotImplementation.

All review commands now use explicit phase-specific constraint sections for consistency, even when phases share identical constraints.

<InitialReviewConstraints>
    **Phase: Initial Review (Finding Generation)**

    <!-- Phase-Specific: Execute before generating findings -->
    - <PlanComprehensionPhase/>  <!-- Forces plan understanding BEFORE critique -->
    - <SkipNotesCheck/>  <!-- Check previously rejected suggestions -->

    <!-- Quality Gates -->
    - <InitialFindingVerificationGates/>  <!-- Verify findings before including them -->

    <!-- Review Principles (shared with Investigation phase) -->
    - <PlanTypeReviewPrinciples/>  <!-- Tailor review to plan type -->
    - <TypeSystemPrinciples/>
    - <AtomicChangeRequirement/>
    - <DuplicationPrevention/>
    - <DocumentComprehension/>
    - <DesignConsistency/>
    - <PlanNotImplementation/>
    - <ImplementationCoverageCheck/>
    - <ImplementationSpecificity/>
    - <LineNumberProhibition/>
</InitialReviewConstraints>

<InvestigationConstraints>
    **Phase: Investigation (Finding Validation)**

    <!-- Quality Gates for Investigation -->
    - <InvestigationVerificationGates/>  <!-- Re-verify during validation -->

    <!-- Review Principles (shared with Initial Review phase) -->
    - <PlanTypeReviewPrinciples/>  <!-- Tailor verdict reasoning to plan type -->
    - <TypeSystemPrinciples/>
    - <AtomicChangeRequirement/>
    - <DuplicationPrevention/>
    - <DocumentComprehension/>
    - <DesignConsistency/>
    - <PlanNotImplementation/>
    - <ImplementationCoverageCheck/>
    - <ImplementationSpecificity/>
    - <LineNumberProhibition/>
</InvestigationConstraints>


<SkipNotesCheck>
**MANDATORY** DO THIS FIRST
Check for a "Design Review Skip Notes" section in the document:
1. Read every single skipped item to understand rejection reasons
2. Cross-reference your ideas against previously rejected concepts
3. Do not re-suggest items marked with "⚠️ PREJUDICE WARNING"
4. Only proceed after confirming recommendations don't duplicate rejected items
</SkipNotesCheck>

<DocumentComprehension>
For plan document reviews:
1. Read the entire plan from beginning to end before making recommendations
2. **MANDATORY REDUNDANCY CHECK**: Before suggesting ANY fix or improvement:
   - Search the ENTIRE plan for "Proposed Fix", "Solution", "Implementation", or similar sections
   - Check if your suggested code already exists ANYWHERE in the plan (even partially)
   - Apply <RedundancyCriteria/> to determine if finding is redundant
3. Quote specific sections when claiming gaps exist
4. Understand how topics connect across different sections
5. For every "missing" claim, either quote the section that should contain it or explain why existing content is insufficient
</DocumentComprehension>

<RedundancyCriteria>
**What makes a finding REDUNDANT:**
- The plan already contains the same or similar code solution
- The plan already describes fixing this exact issue
- A "Proposed Fix" or "Implementation" section addresses the problem you identified
- **CRITICAL**: Plans describe FUTURE changes. Current code NOT matching plan is EXPECTED.
- If your suggested code already appears ANYWHERE in the plan (even partially): REDUNDANT

**When you find redundancy:**
- Quote the exact section containing the existing solution
- Mark as REDUNDANT, not CONFIRMED
- **NEVER** suggest code that already appears in the plan
</RedundancyCriteria>

<GrepForPlanRedundancy>
**How to check if plan already contains your suggestion:**
1. Use Grep tool to search the PLAN DOCUMENT (not codebase)
2. Search for keywords from your proposed suggestion
   - Example: Suggesting "add Ord derive to VariantName" → search: "Ord|PartialOrd|VariantName"
3. If Grep finds matches, use Read tool on those line ranges to verify what plan says
4. Apply <RedundancyCriteria/> to determine if your finding is redundant
</GrepForPlanRedundancy>

<DesignConsistency>
For design document reviews:
1. **Internal Consistency**: Verify that all sections of the plan align with each other
2. **Decision Alignment**: Check that design decisions don't contradict across sections
3. **Terminology Consistency**: Ensure the same terms are used consistently throughout
4. **Architectural Coherence**: Verify that the overall architecture remains coherent
5. **Example Consistency**: Ensure code examples match the described approach
6. **Impact Analysis**: Flag when changes in one section require updates to others
</DesignConsistency>

<AtomicChangeRequirement>
**MIGRATION STRATEGY COMPLIANCE**: Check the plan document for a Migration Strategy marker:

- If you find "**Migration Strategy: Atomic**": Plans must represent complete, indivisible changes. Reject any suggestions for incremental rollouts, backward compatibility, gradual migrations, or hybrid approaches. Either keep current design unchanged OR replace it entirely - no middle ground.

- If you find "**Migration Strategy: Phased**": The plan has explicitly chosen a phased approach. Validate that the phased implementation makes sense and provides appropriate review points and validation steps between phases.

- If neither marker is present: **Default to Atomic** - Apply the atomic change requirements above.

**No Hybrid Approaches**: Do not suggest mixing atomic and phased strategies within the same plan. The migration strategy choice applies to the entire plan.
</AtomicChangeRequirement>

<DuplicationPrevention>
**MANDATORY DUPLICATION DETECTION AND ELIMINATION FOR PLAN DOCUMENTS**:

1. **Types of Duplication to Detect**:

   a) **Existing Duplication** - Already present in the code area being modified
      - Multiple functions doing the same thing
      - Repeated logic across methods
      - The plan should consolidate these, not perpetuate them

   b) **Plan-Introduced Identical** - Plan creates exact copies
      - New function that duplicates an existing function
      - Copy-pasted logic with minor variations
      - Redundant data structures or types
      - Inconsistent reimplementation of existing patterns

   c) **Plan-Introduced Overlap** - Plan creates parallel/competing paths
      - New call flow that overlaps with existing flow
      - Alternative way to accomplish same goal
      - Multiple entry points for same functionality
      - Conflicting approaches to similar problems

2. **Resolution Requirements**:
   - If ANY duplication is detected, the plan MUST be redesigned
   - No "letting them coexist" - eliminate the duplication
   - Choose ONE approach: enhance existing OR fully replace
   - Create a single source of truth

3. **Priority**:
   - All duplication issues are HIGH priority
   - Duplication compounds over time into technical debt
   - Prevention now saves major refactoring later
</DuplicationPrevention>

<PlanNotImplementation>
**CRITICAL - THIS IS A PLAN REVIEW, NOT A CODE AUDIT**:
The plan describes FUTURE changes that haven't been implemented yet.

NEVER report as issues:
- "Proposed types/functions don't exist in codebase"
- "Current code doesn't match the plan"
- "Planned changes haven't been made"

ONLY evaluate:
- Is the plan internally consistent?
- Are the proposed changes well-designed?
- Will the plan achieve its stated goals?
- Are there better approaches?
</PlanNotImplementation>

<ImplementationCoverageCheck>
**MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION COVERAGE ANALYSIS**:
Every stated goal, use case, requirement, or necessary feature MUST have corresponding implementation steps.

**CRITICAL - Plan Type Matters**:
- **Internal Refactoring**: Don't look for user documentation or usage examples - check technical goals only
- **Documentation Plans**: Don't look for feature implementations - check documentation completeness
- **API Design**: Look for contract specifications, not internal implementation details
- **Feature Implementation**: Check user-facing goals against implementation sections
- **NEVER** flag missing features that were never in the plan's stated scope

1. **Extract All Commitments**: Identify every:
   - Stated goal or objective
   - Use case or user story
   - Requirement (functional or non-functional)
   - "Must have" or "should support" statement
   - Example usage that implies functionality
   - "The system will..." or "This enables..." statements

2. **Verify Coverage**: For each commitment, check:
   - Implementation section exists for this feature
   - No goals left unaddressed
   - All use cases have corresponding sections
   - Requirements map to concrete plans

3. **Flag Gaps as IMPLEMENTATION-GAP Issues**: Report when:
   - A goal has no implementation section
   - A use case lacks corresponding code changes
   - A requirement is stated but not addressed
   - Examples show functionality not in implementation
   - "Future work" items that should be current scope

4. **DO NOT Flag**:
   - User-facing examples in internal refactoring plans (not needed)
   - Implementation details in documentation plans (out of scope)
   - Features never claimed by the plan (scope creep)

5. **Priority**: All IMPLEMENTATION-GAP issues are HIGH priority
   - These represent broken promises
   - Users expect these features based on the plan
   - Missing these undermines trust
</ImplementationCoverageCheck>

<ImplementationSpecificity>
**MANDATORY**: All proposed code changes must specify:
1. **File path**: Full relative path from project root (e.g., `src/types.rs`)
2. **Target element**: Function/type/trait being modified (e.g., `validate_input()`)
3. **Context markers**: Parent function/unique patterns since line numbers shift with edits
4. **Concrete changes**: Not "update validation" but "replace string comparison with enum match"
5. **New code location**: For additions, specify where (e.g., "after ValidationError enum")
</ImplementationSpecificity>

<LineNumberProhibition>
**CRITICAL - NO LINE NUMBERS IN DESIGN DOCUMENTS**:
Design documents must NEVER contain line number references because they become stale immediately as code evolves.

**PROHIBITED PATTERNS**:
- "Add after line 64"
- "Insert at line 429"
- "Between lines 66-98"
- "See line 312 for context"

**REQUIRED ALTERNATIVES**:
- **Section references**: "Add to Section: Type Definitions"
- **Structural landmarks**: "After the VariantSignature Display implementation"
- **Function scope**: "Add to the validate_input() function"
- **Code patterns**: "Insert after the MutationStatus enum definition"
- **Relative positioning**: "Before the MutationPathInternal struct"

**ENFORCEMENT**:
- Flag ANY line number reference in plans as a DESIGN issue
- Suggest conversion to structural references
- Line numbers may only appear in JSON location fields for actual code files
- ALL plan text must use structural/semantic references

**RATIONALE**: Line numbers change with every edit, making design documents immediately obsolete and causing implementation confusion.
</LineNumberProhibition>

<PlanComprehensionPhase>
**FOR SUBAGENT USE ONLY - Main agent: pass this constraint to the subagent, do NOT execute it yourself**

**MANDATORY PRE-WORK - COMPLETE BEFORE GENERATING ANY FINDINGS**:

The review subagent MUST complete these steps internally BEFORE generating any findings:

**Step 1: Read the Complete Plan**
- Use Read tool to read the entire plan document from start to finish
- Do NOT skim or keyword search - read every section

**Step 2: Extract Plan Fundamentals (internal analysis - do not output to user)**
Determine the following internally to guide your review:
- **Purpose**: What is this plan trying to achieve? (1-2 sentences)
- **Scope**: What specific area/component does this change? (list)
- **In-Scope**: What does the plan explicitly address? (list)
- **Out-of-Scope**: What does the plan explicitly exclude? (list from plan or inferred)
- **Plan Type**: Classify as ONE of:
  * Internal Refactoring (code structure improvement, no external API changes)
  * API Design (new or modified public APIs)
  * Feature Implementation (new user-facing functionality)
  * Documentation (type guides, examples, internal docs)
  * Bug Fix (correcting incorrect behavior)

**Step 3: Review Approach Selection (internal - do not output)**
Based on plan type, internally determine which review principles apply:
- Internal Refactoring → Focus on: consistency, duplication elimination, architectural coherence
- API Design → Focus on: type safety, error handling, backward compatibility
- Feature Implementation → Focus on: completeness, user experience, edge cases
- Documentation → Focus on: accuracy, clarity, completeness of examples
- Bug Fix → Focus on: root cause addressed, no regressions, test coverage

**Step 4: Terminology Check (internal - do not output)**
Internally identify any domain-specific terms and their meaning in THIS plan's context.

**CRITICAL**: Complete these steps internally to inform your review approach, then proceed directly to generating findings JSON. Do NOT output this analysis to the user - it is internal pre-work only.
</PlanComprehensionPhase>

<InitialFindingVerificationGates>
**MANDATORY SELF-VALIDATION - CHECK EVERY FINDING BEFORE INCLUDING IT**:

For EACH potential finding, verify ALL of these gates pass. If ANY gate fails, DISCARD the finding:

**Gate 1: File Existence**
- If location.code_file is specified:
  * Use Read tool to verify file exists
  * Extract ACTUAL code snippet for current_code
  * If file doesn't exist AND isn't marked as "PLANNED NEW FILE", DISCARD finding

**Gate 2: Section Existence**
- If location.plan_reference cites a section name:
  * Use Grep to search plan for that section heading
  * Confirm section discusses the topic you claim
  * If section doesn't exist, DISCARD finding

**Gate 3: Scope Relevance**
- Is this concern within the plan's stated scope?
- Does the plan claim to address this area?
- If NO to both: DISCARD finding (unless it's a scope gap issue)

**Gate 4: Not Already In Plan**
- **MANDATORY**: Execute <GrepForPlanRedundancy/>
- **DECISION**:
  * If plan already proposes this change: DISCARD finding
  * If plan addresses concern differently: Note for investigation phase, don't discard yet
  * If plan doesn't mention this: Finding passes Gate 4

**Gate 5: Plan Type Alignment**
- Does this finding match the review approach for this plan type?
- Example: Don't apply API design principles to documentation plans
- If misaligned, DISCARD finding

**Gate 6: Not In Skip Notes**
- Check if this suggestion appears in "Design Review Skip Notes"
- If previously rejected, DISCARD finding

**ENFORCEMENT**: Only include findings that pass ALL six gates.
If more than 50% of your draft findings fail these gates, STOP and re-read the plan.
</InitialFindingVerificationGates>

<InvestigationVerificationGates>
**MANDATORY VALIDATION - VERIFY THE FINDING IS LEGITIMATE**:

Before assigning a CONFIRMED or MODIFIED verdict, verify:

**Gate 1: Evidence Exists**
- Can you confirm the issue exists where claimed?
- If file path was cited, does the actual code match the finding's claim?
- If not verifiable, verdict should be REJECTED

**Gate 2: Within Scope**
- Is this issue within the plan's stated scope per PlanComprehensionPhase analysis?
- If outside scope and not a scope gap issue, verdict should be REJECTED

**Gate 3: Not Already Addressed**
- **MANDATORY**: Execute <GrepForPlanRedundancy/>
- **DECISION**:
  * If plan already includes this: verdict = REJECTED, reasoning = "Plan already addresses this in [Section Title]"
  * If plan addresses differently: verdict = REJECTED or MODIFIED, explain plan's approach
  * If plan doesn't address: verdict = CONFIRMED (if otherwise valid)

**Gate 4: Actual Problem**
- Is this a real design issue or misunderstanding?
- Does it align with plan type review principles?
- If misunderstood or category error, verdict should be REJECTED

**ENFORCEMENT**: Only CONFIRM findings that pass all gates.
Use REJECTED verdict liberally when findings fail verification.
</InvestigationVerificationGates>

<PlanTypeReviewPrinciples>
**TAILOR YOUR REVIEW TO THE PLAN TYPE**:

**For Internal Refactoring Plans**:
✓ DO review: Code duplication, consistency, architectural coherence
✓ DO check: Data structure design, function organization
✗ DON'T expect: User documentation, usage examples, backward compatibility concerns
✗ DON'T suggest: New user-facing features, API expansions

**For API Design Plans**:
✓ DO review: Type safety, error handling, backward compatibility
✓ DO check: API surface design, contract clarity
✗ DON'T focus on: Internal implementation details, refactoring opportunities

**For Documentation Plans**:
✓ DO review: Accuracy, clarity, completeness of examples
✓ DO check: Example code correctness, coverage of use cases
✗ DON'T suggest: Implementation changes, type system redesigns
✗ DON'T apply: Runtime validation concerns (handled by subject code)

**For Feature Implementation Plans**:
✓ DO review: Completeness, user experience, edge cases
✓ DO check: Integration points, migration strategy
✗ DON'T confuse: Internal tooling plans with user-facing features

**For Bug Fix Plans**:
✓ DO review: Root cause analysis, regression prevention
✓ DO check: Test coverage, edge case handling
✗ DON'T suggest: Architectural redesigns beyond the fix scope

**CRITICAL**: Applying the wrong review lens is a category error that invalidates findings.
Always reference the Plan Type from PlanComprehensionPhase when evaluating findings.
