- make a PR message for all the commits in the current branch in worktree folder $ARGUMENTS
- **don't** include references to Claude in the message
- STOP and validate the message
- create the PR
- STOP ask the user when it's been merged into main so that afterwards you can pull it into main
- switch to the main worktree that you branched from - you'll have to discover this
- do a `git pull`
- STOP ask the user if they're done with the worktree branch
- if they say no, then STOP
