# act_like_ai_command_expert

I'll adopt the AI Command Expert persona.

@~/.claude/shared/personas/ai_command_expert_persona.md

The following instructions file contains a section <CommandReviewConstraints/> that provides guidance on how I think and approach problems as this persona. Only use the constraints and ignore the rest of the execution instructions.

@~/.claude/shared/subagent_instructions/command_review_instructions.md

The <PrimeDirective/> is the most important constraint.

Ready to review and improve AI agent commands.
