<ExecutionSteps>
    **EXECUTE THESE STEPS IN ORDER:**

    **STEP 0:** Execute <Persona/> to adopt the Software Architect persona
    **STEP 1:** Execute <AnalyzeAndSequence/>
    **STEP 2:** Execute <ImplementationGapAnalysis/>
    **STEP 3:** Execute <ReviewAndConfirm/>
    **STEP 4:** Execute <GenerateCollaborativePlan/>
    **STEP 5:** Execute <ValidateCompleteness/>
</ExecutionSteps>

## STEP 1: ANALYZE AND SEQUENCE

<AnalyzeAndSequence>
    Use TodoWrite tool to create tracking:
    [
        {content: "Validate input arguments and read plan document", status: "pending", activeForm: "Validating input arguments and reading plan document"},
        {content: "Parse plan content and extract components", status: "pending", activeForm: "Parsing plan content and extracting components"},
        {content: "Analyze dependencies and breaking changes", status: "pending", activeForm: "Analyzing dependencies and breaking changes"},
        {content: "Create optimized build sequence", status: "pending", activeForm: "Creating optimized build sequence"}
    ]

    Mark "Validate input arguments and read plan document" as in_progress.

    If $ARGUMENTS is empty:
        Display error: "Usage: upgrade_plan <path-to-plan-file>"
        Exit

    Use Read tool to read the plan document from $ARGUMENTS.

    If file doesn't exist:
        Display error: "Plan file not found: $ARGUMENTS"
        Exit

    If "## EXECUTION PROTOCOL" already exists:
        Execute <HandleExistingCollaborativePlan/>

    Mark "Validate input arguments and read plan document" as completed.
    Mark "Parse plan content and extract components" as in_progress.

    Parse the plan to extract:
    - All implementation tasks and phases
    - All files to be created/modified
    - Build and test commands
    - Dependencies between changes
    - Current document section order

    Mark "Parse plan content and extract components" as completed.
    Mark "Analyze dependencies and breaking changes" as in_progress.

    Analyze dependencies and create optimal build sequence:
    1. Group related changes that should be tested together
    2. Order by compilation/build dependencies
    3. Ensure each step can be independently validated
    4. Minimize context switching between components

    **BREAKING CHANGE ANALYSIS** (Critical for Rust/compiled languages):
    For each proposed change, analyze:
    - Type signature changes that would break compilation
    - Struct/enum field modifications that affect other files
    - Function signature changes that break callers
    - Trait implementation changes
    - Module visibility or path changes

    Identify change groups that MUST be atomic:
    - If changing a type definition used elsewhere, group with all usage updates
    - If modifying a function signature, group with all call site updates
    - If changing an enum variant, group with all match statement updates
    - Mark these as "ATOMIC GROUP - must be done together to avoid breakage"

    Reorganize sequence to:
    1. **Additive changes first** (new types, functions, fields) - won't break anything
    2. **Atomic breaking change groups** - all related changes together
    3. **Dependent changes** - that rely on previous steps
    4. **Cleanup/removal changes last** - removing deprecated items

    **IMPORTANT**: The PROPOSED_SEQUENCE will become the new document order. Design it so that:
    - Each step corresponds to detailed implementation sections that will be reordered
    - The execution sequence can be followed linearly through the document
    - Related content from multiple original sections can be merged into logical steps
    - **Every step should compile successfully** - no intermediate breakage

    Create PROPOSED_SEQUENCE with:
    - Clear indication of which changes are additive (safe)
    - Which changes form atomic groups (must be done together)
    - Compilation status after each step (‚úÖ builds or ‚ùå would break)

    Proceed to Step 2.
</AnalyzeAndSequence>

## STEP 2: IMPLEMENTATION GAP ANALYSIS

<ImplementationGapAnalysis>
    Use TodoWrite tool to track: analyzing completeness, comparing code, identifying gaps, user review.

    Display: "üîç Thinking harder about implementation completeness..."

    Use Task tool:
    - description: "Deep implementation gap analysis"
    - subagent_type: "general-purpose"
    - prompt: <GapAnalysisPrompt/>

    Parse response. If no gaps found:
        Display: "‚úÖ Plan Completeness Check: PASSED"
        Proceed to Step 3.

    If gaps found:
        Count critical gaps.
        Display summary:
        ```
        ‚è∫ ‚úÖ Plan Completeness Check: GAPS FOUND (${gap_count} issues, ${critical_count} CRITICAL)
        ```

        Execute <GapReview/> with parsed gaps array.
        After gap review completes, proceed to Step 3.
</ImplementationGapAnalysis>

<GapAnalysisPrompt>
Think harder about whether this implementation plan is actually complete.
Read actual current code for each file to be modified.

Check for:
1. Vague changes without concrete implementation ("refactor X" without HOW)
2. Missing function signatures, error handling, edge cases
3. Dependencies/integrations the plan doesn't mention
4. Code that will break but isn't updated

For each gap, provide: gap_type, file, current_code, plan_proposal, what's_missing, severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

Return JSON:
{
  "gaps_found": boolean,
  "gap_count": number,
  "gaps": [
    {
      "gap_type": "string",
      "file": "path/to/file",
      "current_code": "code snippet",
      "plan_proposal": "what plan says",
      "what's_missing": "specific details",
      "severity": "CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "assessment"
}
</GapAnalysisPrompt>

<GapReview>
    **Interactive Gap Review - One at a Time**

    Use TodoWrite tool to create tracking for each gap:
    - Create todos for each gap: "Review gap: ${gap_type} in ${file}"
    - Status: "pending" for all initially

    For each gap (in order of severity: CRITICAL ‚Üí HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí LOW):

    1. Mark current gap todo as "in_progress"
    2. Present gap using <GapOutput/> format
    3. Include counter: "(Gap ${current_number} of ${total_gaps})"
    4. Display keywords at column 0:

## Available Actions
- **fix** - Address this gap in the plan before continuing
- **skip** - Accept this gap and continue anyway
- **investigate** - Launch deeper investigation of the gap
- **stop** - Cancel the upgrade process

    5. STOP and wait for user's keyword response
    6. Handle keyword response:

       **If user says "fix":**
       a. Display: "Fixing gap in the plan..."
       b. Use Read tool to read the plan document from $ARGUMENTS
       c. Analyze the gap and determine what needs to be added/clarified in the plan
       d. Use Edit tool to update the plan document with the missing details:
          - Add missing function signatures with complete before/after examples
          - Clarify vague instructions with concrete implementation steps
          - Add missing edge case handling or error handling details
          - Include line-specific references or code snippets
          - Ensure the fix addresses the "what's_missing" from the gap
       e. Display: "‚úÖ Gap fixed in ${$ARGUMENTS}"
       f. Ask: "Ready to continue to the next gap?"
       g. Display keywords:
          - **continue** - Move to next gap
          - **stop** - Cancel the upgrade process
       h. STOP and wait for user response
       i. If user says "continue", mark gap as completed and continue to next gap
       j. If user says "stop", exit upgrade process
       k. Execute <ValidateUserResponse/> with expected_keywords: [continue, stop]

       **If user says "skip":**
       a. Display: "Skipping this gap - accepting it as-is"
       b. Mark gap as skipped
       c. Mark gap todo as completed
       d. Continue to next gap

       **If user says "investigate":**
       a. Display: "üîç Launching deeper investigation..."
       b. Use Task tool with general-purpose subagent:
          - description: "Investigate gap: ${gap_type}"
          - prompt: "Analyze this implementation gap in detail:
                     File: ${file}
                     Gap type: ${gap_type}
                     What plan says: ${plan_proposal}
                     What's missing: ${what's_missing}
                     Current code: ${current_code}

                     Provide:
                     1. Root cause analysis of why this gap exists
                     2. Specific code snippets needed to fill the gap
                     3. Recommended fix with exact text to add to plan
                     4. Verification steps to confirm fix is complete"
       c. Display the investigation results
       d. Re-present the same gap with keywords (user can now choose fix, skip, investigate again, or stop)
       e. STOP and wait for user response
       f. Return to step 6 to handle the new keyword

       **If user says "stop":**
       a. Display: "Gap review cancelled by user"
       b. Exit upgrade process

    7. Execute <ValidateUserResponse/> for initial response with:
       expected_keywords: [fix, skip, investigate, stop]
       option_descriptions: [
           "- **fix** - Address this gap in the plan before continuing",
           "- **skip** - Accept this gap and continue anyway",
           "- **investigate** - Launch deeper investigation of the gap",
           "- **stop** - Cancel the upgrade process"
       ]

    After all gaps reviewed, display summary:
    ```
    Gap Review Complete
    -------------------
    Total gaps: ${total_count}
    Fixed: ${fix_count}
    Skipped: ${skip_count}

    Proceeding to execution sequence proposal...
    ```
</GapReview>

<GapOutput>

</GapOutput>

## STEP 3: REVIEW AND CONFIRM

<ReviewAndConfirm>
    Use TodoWrite tool to create tracking:
    [
        {content: "Present analysis for review", status: "pending", activeForm: "Presenting analysis for review"},
        {content: "Wait for user decision on execution sequence", status: "pending", activeForm: "Waiting for user decision on execution sequence"},
        {content: "Process user feedback", status: "pending", activeForm: "Processing user feedback"}
    ]

    Mark "Present analysis for review" as in_progress.

    Display the proposed collaborative structure:

    ```
    Plan Upgrade Analysis: [filename]
    =====================================

    Current Structure:
    - [X] implementation phases found
    - [Y] files to be modified
    - Migration type: [Atomic/Phased]

    Breaking Change Analysis:
    - [N] additive changes (safe to do independently)
    - [M] atomic change groups (must be done together)
    - All steps verified to compile successfully ‚úÖ

    Proposed Collaborative Execution Sequence:

    Step 1: [Name] [SAFE/ATOMIC GROUP]
      Tasks: [brief description]
      Files: [file1, file2]
      Change Type: [Additive/Breaking/Mixed]
      Build Status: ‚úÖ Compiles successfully
      Build: [build command]

    Step 2: [Name] [SAFE/ATOMIC GROUP]
      Tasks: [brief description]
      Files: [file3, file4]
      Change Type: [Additive/Breaking/Mixed]
      Build Status: ‚úÖ Compiles successfully
      Build: [build command]
      Dependencies: Requires Step 1
      Notes: [Any special considerations for atomic groups]

    [... continue for all steps ...]

    Final Step: Complete Validation
      - Run all tests
      - Verify integration
      - Check success criteria
    ```

    Mark "Present analysis for review" as completed.
    Mark "Wait for user decision on execution sequence" as in_progress.

    Ask user: "Does this execution sequence look correct?"

    ## Available Actions
    - **approve** - Generate the collaborative plan
    - **adjust** - Describe what needs to change
    - **abort** - Cancel the upgrade

    Please select one of the keywords above.
    STOP.

    Mark "Wait for user decision on execution sequence" as completed.
    Mark "Process user feedback" as in_progress.

    Handle user response:
    If response is "approve":
        Mark "Process user feedback" as completed.
        Proceed to Step 4

    If response is "adjust":
        Ask: "What needs to be changed in the sequence?"
        Update PROPOSED_SEQUENCE based on feedback
        Mark "Process user feedback" as completed.
        Return to display and ask again

    If response is "abort":
        Mark "Process user feedback" as completed.
        Exit without changes

    Execute <ValidateUserResponse/> with:
        expected_keywords: [approve, adjust, abort]
        option_descriptions: [
            "- **approve** - Generate the collaborative plan",
            "- **adjust** - Describe what needs to change",
            "- **abort** - Cancel the upgrade"
        ]
</ReviewAndConfirm>

## STEP 4: GENERATE COLLABORATIVE PLAN

<GenerateCollaborativePlan>
    Build the complete collaborative plan as an executable document:

    1. Generate EXECUTION_PROTOCOL section with:
       ```markdown
       ## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

       <Instructions>
       For each step in the implementation sequence:

       1. **DESCRIBE**: Present the changes with:
          - Summary of what will change and why
          - Code examples showing before/after
          - List of files to be modified
          - Expected impact on the system

       2. **AWAIT APPROVAL**: Stop and wait for user confirmation ("go ahead" or similar)

       3. **IMPLEMENT**: Make the changes and stop

       4. **BUILD & VALIDATE**: Execute the build process:
          ```bash
          [extracted build commands]
          ```

       5. **CONFIRM**: Wait for user to confirm the build succeeded

       6. **MARK COMPLETE**: Update this document to mark the step as ${STATUS_COMPLETED}

       7. **PROCEED**: Move to next step only after confirmation
       </Instructions>

       <ExecuteImplementation>
           Find the next ${STATUS_PENDING} step in the INTERACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE below.

           For the current step:
           1. Follow the <Instructions/> above for executing the step
           2. When step is complete, use Edit tool to mark it as ${STATUS_COMPLETED}
           3. Continue to next PENDING step

           If all steps are COMPLETED:
               Display: "${STATUS_SUCCESS} Implementation complete! All steps have been executed."
       </ExecuteImplementation>

       ## INTERACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE
       ```

       For each step in PROPOSED_SEQUENCE:
         * Create STEP entry with objective, changes, files, build commands
         * Include ${STATUS_PENDING} status marker

       Add final validation step

    2. Restructure the original plan:
       - Place EXECUTION_PROTOCOL at the top (making it executable)
       - **REORDER ALL IMPLEMENTATION SECTIONS**: Rearrange the original detailed implementation sections to match the PROPOSED_SEQUENCE order exactly
         * Extract each original implementation section/task
         * Reorder them to follow the same sequence as the execution steps
         * Merge related sections if multiple original sections map to one execution step
         * Ensure the document flows in the same order as the execution sequence
         * This means readers can follow the document linearly and it matches the build order
       - Update Implementation Strategy to reference protocol steps
       - Add Design Review Skip Notes section if missing
       - **CRITICAL**: The final document structure should be:
         1. Title
         2. EXECUTION PROTOCOL
         3. INTERACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE
         4. Reordered implementation sections matching execution sequence
         5. Supporting sections (Testing, Risk Assessment, Success Criteria, etc.)

    3. Save the upgraded plan:
       Generate the new filename by replacing .md with ${UPGRADE_SUFFIX}:
       - Example: "plan-something.md" becomes "plan-something${UPGRADE_SUFFIX}"
       - If no .md extension, append "${UPGRADE_SUFFIX}"

       Write the complete restructured plan to the new filename.

       Display: "${STATUS_SUCCESS} Collaborative plan created: [new-filename]"
       Display: "üìù The plan is now executable - run it to start implementation"

    Display initial summary:
    ```
    Upgrade Complete
    ----------------
    ${STATUS_SUCCESS} Created [new-filename] with collaborative execution protocol
    ${STATUS_SUCCESS} Created [N] collaborative execution steps
    ${STATUS_SUCCESS} Organized [X] tasks into buildable chunks
    ${STATUS_SUCCESS} Each step includes validation commands

    Original: $ARGUMENTS (preserved)
    Upgraded: [new-filename] (created)
    ```

    Store new-filename in UPGRADED_FILE variable for Step 5.
    Proceed to Step 5.
</GenerateCollaborativePlan>

## STEP 5: VALIDATE COMPLETENESS

<ValidateCompleteness>
    Use the Task tool with general-purpose subagent to perform comprehensive validation:

    Prompt: "You are tasked with performing a thorough comparison between an original plan document and its upgraded collaborative version. Your goal is to ensure nothing was lost during the transformation.

    Original file: $ARGUMENTS
    Upgraded file: [UPGRADED_FILE]

    Please analyze and report on the following:

    1. **MISSING CONTENT ANALYSIS**
       - List ANY technical details, code snippets, or specifications from the original that are missing in the upgraded version
       - Check for missing comments, notes, warnings, or considerations
       - Verify all file paths, function names, and variable names are preserved
       - Ensure all edge cases and error handling mentions are retained

    2. **IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS CHECK**
       - Compare code examples line by line - are they identical?
       - Check if all TODO items, FIXME notes, or warnings made it through
       - Verify all configuration values, constants, and magic numbers are preserved
       - Ensure all mentioned dependencies and imports are included

    3. **STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY**
       - Confirm all original sections exist (even if reordered)
       - Check that no subsections were accidentally merged or lost
       - Verify all bullet points and numbered lists are complete
       - Ensure all tables, diagrams references, or external links are preserved

    4. **SEMANTIC COMPLETENESS**
       - Check if the upgraded version maintains the same level of detail
       - Verify no explanations or rationales were summarized away
       - Ensure all alternative approaches or rejected solutions are still documented
       - Confirm all success criteria and acceptance tests are preserved

    5. **VERDICT**
       Provide one of these assessments:
       - ‚úÖ COMPLETE: The upgraded file contains 100% of the original content
       - ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR GAPS: Small formatting or non-critical details missing (list them)
       - ‚ùå MAJOR GAPS: Important implementation details or sections missing (list them)

    **CRITICAL**: You MUST format your response EXACTLY as specified below. The verdict line must match one of the three exact formats for proper parsing.

    Format your response as:
    ```
    VALIDATION REPORT
    =================

    Missing Content:
    - [List any missing items, or 'None found']

    Implementation Differences:
    - [List any code/detail differences, or 'All details preserved']

    Structural Changes:
    - [List any concerning structural issues, or 'Structure intact']

    Verdict: [COMPLETE/MINOR GAPS/MAJOR GAPS]

    [If gaps found, provide specific file:line references where possible]
    ```

    **PARSING REQUIREMENT**: The verdict line MUST be EXACTLY one of these three options:
    - "Verdict: COMPLETE"
    - "Verdict: MINOR GAPS"
    - "Verdict: MAJOR GAPS"

    Do NOT add emojis, parenthetical notes, or any other text to the verdict line."

    Display: "üîç Validating content preservation..."

    After receiving the validation report from the subagent:

    If verdict is COMPLETE:
        Display:
        ```
        ${STATUS_SUCCESS} Validation Complete - No Content Lost
        =========================================
        The upgraded plan contains all original content.

        Final Summary:

        Display:
        ```
        ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation Complete - Minor Gaps Found
        ==========================================

        The following minor items may need attention:
        [List the minor gaps]

        These gaps are non-critical and the plan is usable.

        Final Summary:
        - Original: $ARGUMENTS (preserved)
        - Upgraded: [UPGRADED_FILE] (ready to execute)

        To start implementation, run: @[UPGRADED_FILE]
        ```

    If verdict is MAJOR GAPS:
        Display:
        ```
        ‚ùå Validation Failed - Major Content Missing
        ============================================

        Critical content was lost during upgrade:

        Action Required:
        The upgraded file has significant gaps and should be reviewed.
        Please manually inspect both files or re-run the upgrade.

        Files:
        - Original: $ARGUMENTS
        - Upgraded: [UPGRADED_FILE] (needs review)
