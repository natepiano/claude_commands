**IMPORTANT** don't commit the changes that you will examine. Just do the following:

<CommitPrep>
- run `git status` to ensure you're within a git repository that has uncommitted changes
- create a commit message for the current changes
- stage the changes
- STOP - do not commit the changes
</CommitPrep>

**CRITICAL** don't commit the changes yet - just show the commit message you've created to the user
