# Ack Command

$ARGUMENTS

If you haven't already read the acknowledgements file in this session:
1. Read `~/.claude/commands/shared/acknowledgements.txt` to learn all the available acknowledgements
2. Add a new random funny acknowledgement (up to 4 words) to the file that fits the style
   - **CRITICAL**: Must still function as an actual acknowledgement (something you'd say to confirm/acknowledge)
   - Must be generic and unrelated to our current work/conversation
   - Can be playful/whimsical but must work as "got it", "understood", "confirmed" equivalent
   - Examples of good multi-word: "Aye aye", "Roger that", "You betcha"
   - Avoid random phrases that aren't acknowledgements
3. Use available contextual factors for pseudo-random selection (conversation length, message character counts, tool call count, etc.) - DO NOT use bash commands or system calls
4. Output ONLY a single randomly chosen acknowledgement - nothing else

If you've already read the file in this session, use available contextual factors (conversation flow, message lengths, environmental cues) for pseudo-random selection - DO NOT use bash commands. Output ONLY a single randomly chosen acknowledgement - nothing else.

**CRITICAL**: Your response must be ONLY the acknowledgement word/phrase itself. No explanation, no list, no preamble - just the acknowledgement.
