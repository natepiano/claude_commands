# Ack Command

$ARGUMENTS

If you haven't already read the acknowledgements file in this session:
1. Read `~/.claude/commands/shared/acknowledgements.txt` to learn all the available acknowledgements

Now that you'veread the file in this session, use available contextual factors (conversation flow, message lengths, environmental cues) for pseudo-random selection - DO NOT use bash commands. Output ONLY a single randomly chosen acknowledgement - nothing else.

**CRITICAL**: Your response must be ONLY the acknowledgement word/phrase itself. No explanation, no list, no preamble - just the acknowledgement.
