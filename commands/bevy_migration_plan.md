description: Generate project-specific Bevy migration plan by analyzing the current codebase against official migration guides
---

# Bevy Migration Plan Generator

Analyzes your codebase against official Bevy migration guides using a two-pass parallel subagent strategy to generate a comprehensive, project-specific migration plan.

**Usage:** `/bevy_migration_plan <version> [path]`
**Examples:**
- `/bevy_migration_plan 0.17.1` (analyze current directory)
- `/bevy_migration_plan 0.17.1 ~/rust/my_game` (analyze specific project)

**Output:**
- `{path}/.claude/bevy_migration/bevy-{version}-guides.md` (combined guides)
- `{path}/.claude/bevy_migration/bevy-{version}-migration-plan.md` (migration plan)

---

## Execution Strategy

**Two-Pass Parallel Subagent Analysis:**

1. **Pass 1 - Quick Applicability Filter**: 10 subagents analyze 11-12 guides each to identify which guides apply to this codebase (fast pattern matching)
2. **Pass 2 - Deep Analysis**: N subagents (one per applicable guide) perform detailed code analysis and generate migration instructions

<ParseArguments>

**Extract version and optional path from arguments:**

The command receives `$ARGUMENTS` containing:
- First argument: Bevy version (e.g., "0.17.1") - REQUIRED
- Second argument: Path to codebase to analyze (e.g., "~/rust/my_game") - OPTIONAL

**Validation:**
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, output error: "Error: Version argument required. Usage: /bevy_migration_plan <version> [path]"
- Stop execution if version is missing

**Parse arguments:**
- Split `$ARGUMENTS` on whitespace
- First token = VERSION
- Second token (if present) = CODEBASE_PATH
- If CODEBASE_PATH not provided, use `$PWD`

**Define execution values:**

```
VERSION = [first argument] (e.g., "0.17.1")
CODEBASE = [second argument or $PWD] (e.g., "~/rust/my_game" or current directory)
BEVY_REPO_DIR = ${HOME}/rust/bevy-${VERSION} (global, reusable across projects)
GUIDES_DIR = ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/release-content/migration-guides
COMBINED_GUIDES = ${CODEBASE}/.claude/bevy_migration/bevy-${VERSION}-guides.md
MIGRATION_PLAN = ${CODEBASE}/.claude/bevy_migration/bevy-${VERSION}-migration-plan.md
```

**Path Expansion Note:**
- When constructing bash commands, ensure tildes are expanded to actual paths
- If CODEBASE contains tilde (e.g., user provides "~/rust/my_game"), expand it before using in bash commands
- Use `${HOME}` instead of `~` in all template definitions to avoid ambiguity
- BEVY_REPO_DIR already uses `${HOME}` for reliable path resolution across all contexts

**Note:** The Bevy repository is cloned to a global location (`${HOME}/rust/bevy-${VERSION}`) to avoid duplicate clones, but the output files (combined guides and migration plan) are saved in the target project's `.claude/bevy_migration/` directory.

<GenerateCombinedGuides>

**Create TODO list:**

```
[
  {"content": "Validate Bevy version exists on GitHub", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Validating Bevy version exists on GitHub"},
  {"content": "Clone Bevy repository (if needed)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Cloning Bevy repository"},
  {"content": "Generate combined migration guides file", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Generating combined migration guides file"},
  {"content": "Check dependency compatibility", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Checking dependency compatibility"},
  {"content": "Pass 1: Filter applicable guides (10 parallel subagents)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Pass 1: Filtering applicable guides"},
  {"content": "Pass 2: Deep analysis (N parallel subagents)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Pass 2: Deep analysis of applicable guides"},
  {"content": "Merge and present migration plan", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Merging and presenting migration plan"}
]
```

**Validate version exists on GitHub:**

```bash
gh api repos/bevyengine/bevy/releases/tags/v${VERSION}
```

**If error (404 or other):**
- Show error message: "Error: Bevy version ${VERSION} not found on GitHub"
- Try to list available recent versions:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/bevyengine/bevy/releases --jq '.[0:10] | .[] | .tag_name'
  ```
- Show message: "Available recent versions: ..."
- Stop execution

**Mark TODO as completed and next as in_progress**

**Clone repository if needed:**

```bash
if [ -d "${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/.git" ]; then
  echo "Repository already exists at ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}"
  git -C "${BEVY_REPO_DIR}" checkout "v${VERSION}"
else
  echo "Cloning Bevy ${VERSION} to ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}"
  rm -rf "${BEVY_REPO_DIR}"  # Clean any partial/corrupt directories
  mkdir -p "$(dirname "${BEVY_REPO_DIR}")"
  git clone https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy.git "${BEVY_REPO_DIR}"
  git -C "${BEVY_REPO_DIR}" checkout "v${VERSION}"
fi
```

**Verify migration guides exist:**

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/verify_migration_guides.sh "${GUIDES_DIR}"
```

**Mark TODO as completed and next as in_progress**

**Generate combined guides file:**

```bash
mkdir -p "${CODEBASE}/.claude/bevy_migration"
echo "Generating combined guides file..."
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_combine_guides.py "${VERSION}" "${GUIDES_DIR}" "${COMBINED_GUIDES}"
```

**The script outputs:**
- Combined markdown file with all 114 migration guides
- Table of Contents with 10 subagent sections
- Each guide marked with its line number for easy reference

**Verify the file was created:**
```bash
ls -lh "${COMBINED_GUIDES}"
```

**Mark TODO as completed and next as in_progress**

</GenerateCombinedGuides>

---

<DependencyCompatibilityCheck>

**Run dependency compatibility check:**

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_dependency_check.py --bevy-version "${VERSION}" --codebase "${CODEBASE}"
```

**The script will:**
- Run `cargo tree` to discover all bevy-dependent crates (direct and indirect)
- Query crates.io for each dependency to find compatible versions
- Classify each dependency as:
  - **üö´ BLOCKER**: No compatible version exists - cannot migrate
  - **üîÑ UPDATE_REQUIRED**: Compatible version exists - must update Cargo.toml
  - **‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK_NEEDED**: Compatibility unclear - needs manual testing
  - **‚úÖ OK**: Already compatible

**Output:**
- Markdown section with dependency compatibility review
- Includes clear explanations of each classification category
- Lists specific actions needed for each dependency

**Capture the output:**

Store the script's stdout output in a variable for later merging into the final migration plan. This section will appear immediately after the Summary section and before the REQUIRED Changes section.

**Mark TODO as completed and next as in_progress**

</DependencyCompatibilityCheck>

<Pass1_ApplicabilityFilter>

**Launch 10 parallel subagents for quick applicability filtering:**

Use the Task tool to launch 10 general-purpose subagents **in a single message** (parallel execution).

**For each subagent (1-10):**

```
Subagent ${N} Task:

You are analyzing Bevy ${VERSION} migration guides to determine which ones apply to this codebase.

**Your assigned guides:**
Read the "Subagent ${N}" section from the Table of Contents in ${COMBINED_GUIDES}. This lists your assigned migration guide numbers and their line numbers.

**Your task:**

For EACH of your assigned guides:

1. Read the guide at the specified line number in ${COMBINED_GUIDES}
2. Extract 3-5 key search patterns from the guide (types, functions, modules mentioned)
3. Run quick ripgrep searches in ${CODEBASE} for these patterns:
   ```bash
   rg "pattern" --type rust "${CODEBASE}"
   ```
4. Determine: APPLICABLE or NOT_APPLICABLE

**Output format (respond with ONLY this structured list):**

```
APPLICABLE_GUIDES:
- Guide N: [title] - Found [X] occurrences of [key_pattern]
- Guide M: [title] - Found [Y] occurrences of [key_pattern]

NOT_APPLICABLE_GUIDES:
- Guide K: [title] - No matches found
- Guide L: [title] - No matches found
```

**Rules:**
- Mark as APPLICABLE if you find ANY occurrences of relevant patterns
- Mark as NOT_APPLICABLE only if you find ZERO occurrences
- Do NOT include detailed analysis in Pass 1 - just presence/absence
- Do NOT read the entire codebase - use targeted ripgrep searches only
- Your response should be concise (1-2 lines per guide)

**Working directory:** ${CODEBASE}
```

**Wait for all 10 subagents to complete:**

Collect results from all subagents. Parse the APPLICABLE_GUIDES lists to build a master list of applicable guide numbers.

**Mark TODO as completed and next as in_progress**

</Pass1_ApplicabilityFilter>

---

<Pass2_DetailedAnalysis>

**Launch N parallel subagents (one per applicable guide):**

From Pass 1, you now have a list of applicable guide numbers. For each applicable guide, launch ONE general-purpose subagent to perform deep analysis.

**IMPORTANT:** Launch all subagents in a **single message** with multiple Task tool calls for maximum parallelism.

**For each applicable guide:**

```
Deep Analysis Task for Guide ${GUIDE_NUM}:

You are performing detailed migration analysis for a single Bevy ${VERSION} migration guide.

**Your guide:**
Guide ${GUIDE_NUM} in ${COMBINED_GUIDES} at line ${LINE_NUM}

**Your task:**

1. **Read the full guide** from ${COMBINED_GUIDES}
2. **Extract ALL identifiers** mentioned in the guide:
   - Types, traits, functions, methods, modules
   - Old names (being removed/renamed)
   - New names (replacements)

3. **Search the codebase** for EVERY identifier:
   ```bash
   rg "identifier" --type rust -C 3 "${CODEBASE}"
   ```

4. **Classify requirement level:**
   - REQUIRED: Breaking changes that will cause compilation failures
   - HIGH: Deprecated features that still compile but need migration
   - MEDIUM: Optional improvements or new features
   - LOW: Minor changes or optimizations

5. **Generate markdown section** with this EXACT structure:

```markdown
## Guide ${GUIDE_NUM}: [Title from guide]

**Requirement Level:** [REQUIRED/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Occurrences:** [X] locations across [Y] files

### Migration Guide Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of what changed and why]

### Affected Code Locations

**File: `[path/to/file.rs]`** ([N] occurrences)
```rust
// Context from surrounding code (3-5 lines)
[actual code snippet from your search]
// More context
```

[Repeat for each affected file, limit to top 10 files if more]

### Migration Instructions

1. [Specific step-by-step instructions for this codebase]
2. [Reference the official guide for details]
3. [Note any special considerations for this project]

### Search Pattern

To find all occurrences:
```bash
rg "pattern" --type rust
```

---
```

**Output Requirements:**
- Generate ONLY the markdown section above
- Include actual code snippets from ${CODEBASE}
- Use relative paths from ${CODEBASE}
- Limit to top 10 most important locations if there are many
- Be specific to THIS codebase, not generic
- Do NOT use line numbers (they become stale)
- Use 3-5 lines of context around each match
- **CRITICAL**: Start your response with "## Guide" - no preamble or commentary
- **CRITICAL**: Include the "**Requirement Level:**" field - required for sorting
- **CRITICAL**: End with the triple-dash separator (---) - nothing after

**Working directory:** ${CODEBASE}
**Combined guides:** ${COMBINED_GUIDES}
```

**Wait for all N subagents to complete:**

Collect markdown sections from each subagent.

**Validate subagent outputs:**

For each section, verify it contains a parseable "**Requirement Level:**" field (REQUIRED/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). If a section is missing this field or has unparseable content, report an error message indicating which guide failed validation and skip that guide with a note in the final plan's "Issues During Analysis" section.

**Mark TODO as completed and next as in_progress**

</Pass2_DetailedAnalysis>

---

<MergeMigrationPlan>

**Merge all subagent outputs into final migration plan:**

1. **Create output directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "${CODEBASE}/.claude/bevy_migration"
   ```

2. **Sort sections by requirement level:**
   - REQUIRED guides first
   - Then HIGH
   - Then MEDIUM
   - Then LOW

3. **Generate final document structure:**

```markdown
# Bevy ${VERSION} Migration Plan

**Generated:** [timestamp]
**Codebase:** ${CODEBASE}
**Total Applicable Guides:** [N]

## Notes

- The Bevy repo is cloned globally to `~/rust/bevy-{version}/` (reusable across all projects)
- Both the combined guides file and migration plan are saved to the target project's `.claude/bevy_migration/` directory
- Pass 1 is fast (simple pattern matching across 10 subagents)
- Pass 2 is thorough (one subagent per applicable guide does deep analysis)
- Run this command once per Bevy version per project
- Re-running overwrites both files (useful for testing or as you make progress)
- Can analyze different projects by specifying the path argument
- Useful for comparing migration needs across multiple Bevy projects
