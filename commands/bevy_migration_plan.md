description: Generate project-specific Bevy migration plan by analyzing the current codebase against official migration guides
---

# Bevy Migration Plan Generator

Analyzes your codebase against official Bevy migration guides using a two-pass parallel subagent strategy to generate a comprehensive, project-specific migration plan.

**Usage:** `/bevy_migration_plan <version> [path]`
**Examples:**
- `/bevy_migration_plan 0.17.1` (analyze current directory)
- `/bevy_migration_plan 0.17.1 ~/rust/my_game` (analyze specific project)

**Output:**
- `{path}/.claude/bevy_migration/bevy-{version}-guides.md` (combined guides)
- `{path}/.claude/bevy_migration/bevy-{version}-migration-plan.md` (migration plan)

**EXECUTE THESE STEPS IN ORDER:**

**STEP 1:** Execute <ParseArguments/>
**STEP 2:** Execute <CloneRepository/>
**STEP 3:** Execute <DependencyCompatibilityCheck/>
**STEP 4:** Execute <Pass1_ApplicabilityFilter/>
**STEP 5:** Execute <Pass2_DetailedAnalysis/>
**STEP 6:** Execute <MergeMigrationPlan/>
**STEP 7:** Execute <PresentResults/>

</ExecutionSteps>

---

<ParseArguments>

**Extract version and optional path from arguments:**

The command receives `$ARGUMENTS` containing:
- First argument: Bevy version (e.g., "0.17.1") - REQUIRED
- Second argument: Path to codebase to analyze (e.g., "~/rust/my_game") - OPTIONAL

**Validation:**
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, output error: "Error: Version argument required. Usage: /bevy_migration_plan <version> [path]"
- Stop execution if version is missing

**Parse arguments:**
- Split `$ARGUMENTS` on whitespace
- First token = VERSION
- Second token (if present) = CODEBASE_PATH
- If CODEBASE_PATH not provided, use `$PWD`

**Define execution values:**

```
VERSION = [first argument] (e.g., "0.17.1")
CODEBASE = [second argument or $PWD] (e.g., "~/rust/my_game" or current directory)
BEVY_REPO_DIR = ${HOME}/rust/bevy-${VERSION} (global, reusable across projects)
GUIDES_DIR = ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/release-content/migration-guides
MIGRATION_PLAN = ${CODEBASE}/.claude/bevy_migration/bevy-${VERSION}-migration-plan.md
```

**Path Expansion Note:**
- When constructing bash commands, ensure tildes are expanded to actual paths
- If CODEBASE contains tilde (e.g., user provides "~/rust/my_game"), expand it before using in bash commands
- Use `${HOME}` instead of `~` in all template definitions to avoid ambiguity
- BEVY_REPO_DIR already uses `${HOME}` for reliable path resolution across all contexts

**Note:** The Bevy repository is cloned to a global location (`${HOME}/rust/bevy-${VERSION}`) to avoid duplicate clones. The migration plan is saved in the target project's `.claude/bevy_migration/` directory.

</ParseArguments>

<Pass2OutputTemplate>
Generate markdown section with this EXACT structure:

```markdown
## [Title from guide or filename without .md]

**Guide File:** `${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}`
**Requirement Level:** [REQUIRED/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Occurrences:** [X] locations across [Y] files

### Migration Guide Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of what changed and why]

### Affected Code Locations

**File: `[path/to/file.rs]`** ([N] occurrences)
```rust
// Context from surrounding code (3-5 lines)
[actual code snippet from your search]
// More context
```

[Repeat for each affected file, limit to top 10 files if more]

### Migration Instructions

1. [Specific step-by-step instructions for this codebase]
2. [Reference the official guide for details: see guide file above]
3. [Note any special considerations for this project]

### Search Pattern

To find all occurrences:
```bash
rg "pattern" --type rust
```

---
```

**Output Requirements:**
- Generate ONLY the markdown section above
- Include actual code snippets from ${CODEBASE}
- Use relative paths from ${CODEBASE}
- Limit to top 10 most important locations if there are many
- Be specific to THIS codebase, not generic
- Do NOT use line numbers (they become stale)
- Use 3-5 lines of context around each match
- **CRITICAL**: Start your response with "##" followed by the title - no preamble or commentary
- **CRITICAL**: Include the "**Guide File:**" line with full path to the guide
- **CRITICAL**: Include the "**Requirement Level:**" field - required for sorting
- **CRITICAL**: End with the triple-dash separator (---) - nothing after
</Pass2OutputTemplate>

---

<CloneRepository>

**Create TODO list:**

```
[
  {"content": "Validate Bevy version exists on GitHub", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Validating Bevy version exists on GitHub"},
  {"content": "Clone Bevy repository (if needed)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Cloning Bevy repository"},
  {"content": "Check dependency compatibility", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Checking dependency compatibility"},
  {"content": "Pass 1: Filter applicable guides (10 parallel subagents)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Pass 1: Filtering applicable guides"},
  {"content": "Pass 2: Deep analysis (N parallel subagents)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Pass 2: Deep analysis of applicable guides"},
  {"content": "Merge and present migration plan", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Merging and presenting migration plan"}
]
```

**Validate version exists on GitHub:**

```bash
gh api repos/bevyengine/bevy/releases/tags/v${VERSION}
```

**If error (404 or other):**
- Show error message: "Error: Bevy version ${VERSION} not found on GitHub"
- Try to list available recent versions:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/bevyengine/bevy/releases --jq '.[0:10] | .[] | .tag_name'
  ```
- Show message: "Available recent versions: ..."
- Stop execution

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="Validate Bevy version exists on GitHub" new_task="Clone Bevy repository (if needed)"/>

**Clone repository if needed:**

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_ensure_repo.sh "${VERSION}"
```

**Verify migration guides exist:**

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/verify_migration_guides.sh "${GUIDES_DIR}"
```

**Create output directory:**

```bash
mkdir -p "${CODEBASE}/.claude/bevy_migration"
```

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="Clone Bevy repository (if needed)" new_task="Check dependency compatibility"/>

</CloneRepository>

---

<DependencyCompatibilityCheck>

**Run dependency compatibility check and save output:**

```bash
DEPENDENCY_OUTPUT="/tmp/bevy_deps_${VERSION}.md"
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_dependency_check.py --bevy-version "${VERSION}" --codebase "${CODEBASE}" --output "${DEPENDENCY_OUTPUT}"
```

**The script will:**
- Run `cargo tree` to discover all bevy-dependent crates (direct and indirect)
- Query crates.io for each dependency to find compatible versions
- Classify each dependency as:
  - **üö´ BLOCKER**: No compatible version exists - cannot migrate
  - **üîÑ UPDATE_REQUIRED**: Compatible version exists - must update Cargo.toml
  - **‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK_NEEDED**: Compatibility unclear - needs manual testing
  - **‚úÖ OK**: Already compatible
- Output markdown section with dependency compatibility review
- Includes clear explanations of each classification category
- Lists specific actions needed for each dependency

The output file will be read during MergeMigrationPlan step and inserted after the Summary section.

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="Check dependency compatibility" new_task="Pass 1: Filter applicable guides (10 parallel subagents)"/>

</DependencyCompatibilityCheck>

---

<Pass1_ApplicabilityFilter>

**Launch 10 parallel subagents for quick applicability filtering:**

Use the Task tool to launch 10 general-purpose subagents **in a single message** (parallel execution).

**For each subagent (1-10):**

Create a Task tool call with description: `"Pass 1: Subagent ${N}"`

**Task prompt:**

```
Pass 1 Analysis - Subagent ${N} of 10:

You are analyzing Bevy ${VERSION} migration guides to determine which ones apply to this codebase.

**Get your assigned guides:**

Run this script to get your tranche of migration guide files:
```bash
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_get_tranche.py \
  --guides-dir "${GUIDES_DIR}" \
  --subagent-index ${N}
```

This outputs JSON with "assigned_guides" array containing the guide file paths you should analyze.

**Your task:**

For EACH guide file in your assigned_guides:

1. Read the guide file from ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/<path from assigned_guides>
2. Extract 3-5 key search patterns from the guide (types, functions, modules mentioned)
3. Run quick ripgrep searches in ${CODEBASE} for these patterns:
   ```bash
   rg "pattern" --type rust "${CODEBASE}"
   ```
4. Determine: APPLICABLE or NOT_APPLICABLE

**Output format (respond with ONLY this JSON):**

```json
{
  "applicable_files": [
    "release-content/migration-guides/some_guide.md",
    "release-content/migration-guides/another_guide.md"
  ],
  "not_applicable_files": [
    "release-content/migration-guides/irrelevant_guide.md"
  ]
}
```

**Rules:**
- Include file path in "applicable_files" array if you find ANY occurrences
- Include file path in "not_applicable_files" array if you find ZERO occurrences
- Do NOT include detailed analysis in Pass 1 - just presence/absence
- Do NOT read the entire codebase - use targeted ripgrep searches only
- Output MUST be valid JSON

**Working directory:** ${CODEBASE}
**Bevy repository:** ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}
```

**Wait for all 10 subagents to complete:**

**Extract applicable guide files:**

1. Parse JSON from all 10 subagent outputs:
   - Each subagent returns JSON with "applicable_files" and "not_applicable_files" arrays
   - Merge all "applicable_files" arrays into single list of unique file paths
   - Store this as APPLICABLE_GUIDE_FILES (list of file paths)

**Handle zero applicable guides edge case:**

If APPLICABLE_GUIDE_FILES is empty (no applicable guides found):
1. Skip Pass 2 entirely
2. Create minimal migration plan at ${MIGRATION_PLAN} stating no guides apply
3. Update TODO: mark "Pass 1" completed, mark "Pass 2" completed (skipped)
4. Jump to PresentResults with appropriate messaging

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="Pass 1: Filter applicable guides (10 parallel subagents)" new_task="Pass 2: Deep analysis (N parallel subagents)"/>

</Pass1_ApplicabilityFilter>

---

<Pass2_DetailedAnalysis>

**Launch N parallel subagents (one per applicable guide):**

From Pass 1, you now have APPLICABLE_GUIDE_FILES - a list of guide file paths like:
- `release-content/migration-guides/some_guide.md`
- `release-content/migration-guides/another_guide.md`

**IMPORTANT:** Launch all subagents in a **single message** with multiple Task tool calls for maximum parallelism.

**For each guide file in APPLICABLE_GUIDE_FILES:**

Iterate through APPLICABLE_GUIDE_FILES. For each file path, create a Task tool call with:

**Task description parameter:**
```
"Deep Analysis: ${GUIDE_FILENAME} (${CURRENT_INDEX} of ${TOTAL_COUNT})"
```

Where:
- `${GUIDE_FILENAME}` is the basename of the guide file (e.g., "some_guide.md")
- `${CURRENT_INDEX}` is the 1-based position in APPLICABLE_GUIDE_FILES
- `${TOTAL_COUNT}` is the total number of applicable guides

**Task prompt parameter (substitute ${GUIDE_FILE_PATH} from current iteration):**

```
Deep Analysis Task for ${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}:

You are performing detailed migration analysis for a single Bevy ${VERSION} migration guide.

**Your guide:**
${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}

**Your task:**

1. **Read the full guide** from ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}
2. **Extract ALL identifiers** mentioned in the guide:
   - Types, traits, functions, methods, modules
   - Old names (being removed/renamed)
   - New names (replacements)

3. **Search the codebase** for EVERY identifier:
   ```bash
   rg "identifier" --type rust -C 3 "${CODEBASE}"
   ```

4. **Classify requirement level:**
   - REQUIRED: Breaking changes that will cause compilation failures
   - HIGH: Deprecated features that still compile but need migration
   - MEDIUM: Optional improvements or new features
   - LOW: Minor changes or optimizations

5. Generate output using <Pass2OutputTemplate/> format
   - In the output, include a link to the guide file: ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}
   - Use the guide filename (without .md extension) as the title if no title is in the guide

**Working directory:** ${CODEBASE}
**Bevy repository:** ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}
**Guide file:** ${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}
```

**Wait for all N subagents to complete:**

Collect markdown sections from each subagent.

**Validate subagent outputs:**

For each section, verify it contains a parseable "**Requirement Level:**" field (REQUIRED/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). If a section is missing this field or has unparseable content, report an error message indicating which guide failed validation and skip that guide with a note in the final plan's "Issues During Analysis" section.

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="Pass 2: Deep analysis (N parallel subagents)" new_task="Merge and present migration plan"/>

</Pass2_DetailedAnalysis>

---

<MergeMigrationPlan>

**Merge all subagent outputs into final migration plan:**

1. **Create output directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "${CODEBASE}/.claude/bevy_migration"
   ```

2. **Read dependency compatibility output:**

   Use Read tool to read ${DEPENDENCY_OUTPUT}.
   Store this content to insert after the Summary section.

3. **Sort sections by requirement level:**
   - REQUIRED guides first
   - Then HIGH
   - Then MEDIUM
   - Then LOW

4. **Generate final document structure:**

```markdown
# Bevy ${VERSION} Migration Plan

**Generated:** [timestamp]
**Codebase:** ${CODEBASE}
**Total Applicable Guides:** [N]

---

## Summary

- **REQUIRED changes:** [X] guides ([Y] total occurrences)
- **HIGH priority:** [X] guides ([Y] total occurrences)
- **MEDIUM priority:** [X] guides ([Y] total occurrences)
- **LOW priority:** [X] guides ([Y] total occurrences)

**Estimated effort:** [Based on occurrence counts]
- REQUIRED: [Large/Medium/Small] (must fix to compile)
- HIGH: [Large/Medium/Small] (should fix soon)
- MEDIUM: [Large/Medium/Small] (optional improvements)
- LOW: [Large/Medium/Small] (nice to have)

---

[Read and insert dependency output from ${DEPENDENCY_OUTPUT} here]

---

## REQUIRED Changes

[Sections from Pass 2 for REQUIRED guides - each section includes **Guide File:** link]

---

## HIGH Priority Changes

[Sections from Pass 2 for HIGH guides - each section includes **Guide File:** link]

---

## MEDIUM Priority Changes

[Sections from Pass 2 for MEDIUM guides - each section includes **Guide File:** link]

---

## LOW Priority Changes

[Sections from Pass 2 for LOW guides - each section includes **Guide File:** link]

---

## Guides Not Applicable to This Codebase

The following [X] guides from Bevy ${VERSION} do not apply to this codebase.

[List file paths from Pass 1 not_applicable_files arrays - no need to read the files, just list them]

---

## Next Steps

1. Start with REQUIRED changes (must fix to compile with Bevy ${VERSION})
2. Address HIGH priority changes (deprecated features)
3. Consider MEDIUM and LOW priority improvements
4. Test thoroughly after each category of changes
5. Run `cargo check` and `cargo test` frequently

## Reference

- **Migration guides directory:** ${GUIDES_DIR}
- **Bevy ${VERSION} release notes:** https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/releases/tag/v${VERSION}
```

5. **Write final migration plan:**

   Use Write tool to create ${MIGRATION_PLAN} with the following structure:
   - Header with metadata (generated timestamp, codebase path, total guides)
   - Summary section with occurrence counts by priority level
   - Dependency compatibility section (content from ${DEPENDENCY_OUTPUT})
   - REQUIRED Changes section (Pass 2 sections with REQUIRED level - each includes **Guide File:** link)
   - HIGH Priority Changes section (Pass 2 sections with HIGH level - each includes **Guide File:** link)
   - MEDIUM Priority Changes section (Pass 2 sections with MEDIUM level - each includes **Guide File:** link)
   - LOW Priority Changes section (Pass 2 sections with LOW level - each includes **Guide File:** link)
   - Guides Not Applicable section (file paths from Pass 1 not_applicable_files - just list the paths)
   - Next Steps section
   - Reference section (link to ${GUIDES_DIR})

   Concatenate all sections in this order and write to ${MIGRATION_PLAN} using Write tool.

**Note:** The final TODO update happens in PresentResults after displaying the summary.
