description: Generate project-specific Bevy migration plan by analyzing the current codebase against official migration guides
---

# Bevy Migration Plan Generator

Analyzes your codebase against official Bevy migration guides using a two-pass parallel subagent strategy to generate a comprehensive, project-specific migration plan.

**Usage:** `/bevy_migration_plan <version> [path]`
**Examples:**
- `/bevy_migration_plan 0.17.1` (analyze current directory)
- `/bevy_migration_plan 0.17.1 ~/rust/my_game` (analyze specific project)

**Output:**
- `{path}/.claude/bevy_migration/bevy-{version}-guides.md` (combined guides)
- `{path}/.claude/bevy_migration/bevy-{version}-migration-plan.md` (migration plan)

**EXECUTE THESE STEPS IN ORDER:**

**STEP 0:** Execute <Persona/> to adopt the Principal Engineer persona
**STEP 1:** Execute <ParseArguments/>
**STEP 2:** Execute <CloneRepository/>
**STEP 3:** Execute <DependencyCompatibilityCheck/>
**STEP 4:** Execute <Pass1_ApplicabilityFilter/>
**STEP 5:** Execute <Pass2_DetailedAnalysis/>
**STEP 6:** Execute <MergeMigrationPlan/>
**STEP 7:** Execute <PresentResults/>

</ExecutionSteps>

---

<ParseArguments>

**Extract version and optional path from arguments:**

The command receives `$ARGUMENTS` containing:
- First argument: Bevy version (e.g., "0.17.1") - REQUIRED
- Second argument: Path to codebase to analyze (e.g., "~/rust/my_game") - OPTIONAL

**Validation:**
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, output error: "Error: Version argument required. Usage: /bevy_migration_plan <version> [path]"
- Stop execution if version is missing

**Parse arguments:**
- Split `$ARGUMENTS` on whitespace
- First token = VERSION
- Second token (if present) = CODEBASE_PATH
- If CODEBASE_PATH not provided, use `$PWD`

**Define execution values:**

```
VERSION = [first argument] (e.g., "0.17.1")
CODEBASE = [second argument or $PWD] (e.g., "~/rust/my_game" or current directory)
BEVY_REPO_DIR = ${HOME}/rust/bevy-${VERSION} (global, reusable across projects)
GUIDES_DIR = ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/release-content/migration-guides
MIGRATION_PLAN = ${CODEBASE}/.claude/bevy_migration/bevy-${VERSION}-migration-plan.md
```

**Path Expansion Note:**
- When constructing bash commands, ensure tildes are expanded to actual paths
- If CODEBASE contains tilde (e.g., user provides "~/rust/my_game"), expand it before using in bash commands
- Use `${HOME}` instead of `~` in all template definitions to avoid ambiguity
- BEVY_REPO_DIR already uses `${HOME}` for reliable path resolution across all contexts

**Note:** The Bevy repository is cloned to a global location (`${HOME}/rust/bevy-${VERSION}`) to avoid duplicate clones. The migration plan is saved in the target project's `.claude/bevy_migration/` directory.

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="..." new_task="...">
Use TodoWrite tool to update the todo list - mark "${old_task}" as completed and "${new_task}" as in_progress.
</UpdateTodoProgress>

---

<Pass2OutputTemplate>
Generate markdown section with this EXACT structure:

```markdown
## [Title from guide or filename without .md]

**Guide File:** `${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}`
**Requirement Level:** [REQUIRED/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Occurrences:** [X] locations across [Y] files
**Pass 1 Count:** [Z] | **Pass 2 Count:** [X] | **Status:** [MATCH/ANOMALY: ¬±N%]

### Migration Guide Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of what changed and why]

### Required Changes

**1. Update [description] in `path/to/file.rs`**
```diff
- [old code]
+ [new code]
```

**2. Update [description] in `path/to/other_file.rs`**
```diff
- [old code]
+ [new code]
```

[Repeat for EVERY occurrence - do not limit to top 10]

### Search Pattern

To find all occurrences:
```bash
rg "pattern" --type rust
```

---
```

**Output Requirements:**
- Generate ONLY the markdown section above
- Show actual before/after diff for EVERY occurrence (no "top 10" limit)
- Use relative paths from ${CODEBASE}
- Use diff format with `-` for old code, `+` for new code
- Be specific to THIS codebase's actual code
- Each change should have:
  - Numbered entry (1, 2, 3, ...)
  - Brief description of what's being updated
  - File path
  - Concrete before/after diff from the actual codebase
- **CRITICAL**: Start your response with "##" followed by the title - no preamble or commentary
- **CRITICAL**: Include the "**Guide File:**" line with full path to the guide
- **CRITICAL**: Include the "**Requirement Level:**" field - required for sorting
- **CRITICAL**: End with the triple-dash separator (---) - nothing after
</Pass2OutputTemplate>

---

<ApplicableGuidesSummary>
Output a formatted list showing all applicable guides found in Pass 1:

```
## Pass 1: Applicable Guides Found

From the 10 subagent outputs, I found these applicable guides:
  1. [guide_name.md] ([total_occurrences] occurrences)
  2. [guide_name.md] ([total_occurrences] occurrences)
  ...

Launching Pass 2 deep analysis for [N] guides...
```

**Requirements:**
- Number each guide sequentially
- Show guide filename (basename only)
- Show Pass 1 total occurrence count in parentheses
- Sort by occurrence count (highest first)
</ApplicableGuidesSummary>

---

<CountingProcedure>

**Standard pattern counting - use this for all occurrence counts:**

Single pattern:
```bash
count=$(~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_count_pattern.sh "pattern" "${CODEBASE}" rust)
```

Multiple patterns with breakdown:
```bash
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_count_pattern.sh --multiple "pattern1" "pattern2" "pattern3" -- "${CODEBASE}" rust
```

Verify Pass 2 counts against Pass 1 total (for Pass 2 validation):
```bash
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_count_pattern.sh --verify \
  --pass1-total ${PASS1_TOTAL} \
  --patterns "pattern1" "pattern2" "pattern3" -- "${CODEBASE}" rust
```

The script outputs:
- Single mode: Just the number (e.g., `42`)
- Multiple mode: JSON with pattern breakdown and `_total` field
- Verify mode: JSON with `pass1_total`, `pass2_total`, `breakdown`, `variance_percent`, and `status` ("MATCH" or "ANOMALY")

**Do NOT write custom Python scripts, echo commands with nested substitutions, or manual counting logic - use this script.**

</CountingProcedure>

---

<CloneRepository>

**Create TODO list:**

```
[
  {"content": "Validate Bevy version exists on GitHub", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Validating Bevy version exists on GitHub"},
  {"content": "Clone Bevy repository (if needed)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Cloning Bevy repository"},
  {"content": "Check dependency compatibility", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Checking dependency compatibility"},
  {"content": "Pass 1: Filter applicable guides (10 parallel subagents)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Pass 1: Filtering applicable guides"},
  {"content": "Pass 2: Deep analysis (N parallel subagents)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Pass 2: Deep analysis of applicable guides"},
  {"content": "Merge and present migration plan", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Merging and presenting migration plan"}
]
```

**Validate version exists on GitHub:**

```bash
gh api repos/bevyengine/bevy/releases/tags/v${VERSION}
```

**If error (404 or other):**
- Show error message: "Error: Bevy version ${VERSION} not found on GitHub"
- Try to list available recent versions:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/bevyengine/bevy/releases --jq '.[0:10] | .[] | .tag_name'
  ```
- Show message: "Available recent versions: ..."
- Stop execution

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="Validate Bevy version exists on GitHub" new_task="Clone Bevy repository (if needed)"/>

**Clone repository if needed:**

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_ensure_repo.sh "${VERSION}"
```

**Verify migration guides exist:**

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_verify_guides.sh "${GUIDES_DIR}"
```

**Create output directory:**

```bash
mkdir -p "${CODEBASE}/.claude/bevy_migration"
```

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="Clone Bevy repository (if needed)" new_task="Check dependency compatibility"/>

</CloneRepository>

---

<DependencyCompatibilityCheck>

**Run dependency compatibility check and save output:**

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_dependency_check.py --bevy-version "${VERSION}" --codebase "${CODEBASE}" --output "/tmp/bevy_migration_deps_$(basename ${CODEBASE}).md"
```

**The script will:**
- Run `cargo tree` to discover all bevy-dependent crates (direct and indirect)
- Query crates.io for each dependency to find compatible versions
- Classify each dependency as:
  - **üö´ BLOCKER**: No compatible version exists - cannot migrate
  - **üîÑ UPDATE_REQUIRED**: Compatible version exists - must update Cargo.toml
  - **‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK_NEEDED**: Compatibility unclear - needs manual testing
  - **‚úÖ OK**: Already compatible
- Output markdown section with dependency compatibility review
- Includes clear explanations of each classification category
- Lists specific actions needed for each dependency

The output file will be `/tmp/bevy_migration_deps_$(basename ${CODEBASE}).md` and will be read during MergeMigrationPlan step and inserted after the Summary section.

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="Check dependency compatibility" new_task="Pass 1: Filter applicable guides (10 parallel subagents)"/>

</DependencyCompatibilityCheck>

---

<Pass1_ApplicabilityFilter>

**Launch 10 parallel subagents for quick applicability filtering:**

Use the Task tool to launch 10 general-purpose subagents **in a single message** (parallel execution).

**For each subagent (1-10):**

Create a Task tool call with description: `"Pass 1: Subagent ${N}"`

**Task prompt:**

```
Pass 1 Analysis - Subagent ${N} of 10:

You are analyzing Bevy ${VERSION} migration guides to determine which ones apply to this codebase.

**Get your assigned guides:**

Run this script to get your tranche of migration guide files:
```bash
~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_get_tranche.py \
  --guides-dir "${GUIDES_DIR}" \
  --subagent-index ${N}
```

This outputs JSON with "assigned_guides" array containing the guide file paths you should analyze.

**Your task:**

For EACH guide file in your assigned_guides:

1. Read the guide file from ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/<path from assigned_guides>
2. Extract 3-5 key search patterns from the guide (types, functions, modules mentioned)
3. Count occurrences for each pattern using <CountingProcedure/>:
   ```bash
   count=$(~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_count_pattern.sh "pattern" "${CODEBASE}" rust)
   ```
4. Determine: APPLICABLE or NOT_APPLICABLE

**Output format (respond with ONLY this JSON):**

```json
{
  "applicable_guides": [
    {
      "guide_path": "release-content/migration-guides/some_guide.md",
      "matched_patterns": [
        {"pattern": "SomeType", "occurrences": 15},
        {"pattern": "some_function", "occurrences": 8}
      ],
      "total_occurrences": 23
    }
  ],
  "not_applicable_guides": [
    {
      "guide_path": "release-content/migration-guides/irrelevant_guide.md",
      "reason": "No matches for any searched patterns"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Rules:**
- For APPLICABLE guides: Include guide_path, ALL patterns you searched, occurrence count for each, and total
- For NOT_APPLICABLE guides: Include guide_path and brief reason
- Track EVERY pattern you search for, even if it has 0 occurrences
- Do NOT include detailed analysis in Pass 1 - just pattern matching results
- Do NOT read the entire codebase - use targeted ripgrep searches only
- Output MUST be valid JSON with the exact structure shown above

**Working directory:** ${CODEBASE}
**Bevy repository:** ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}
```

**Wait for all 10 subagents to complete:**

**Extract applicable guide data:**

1. Parse JSON from all 10 subagent outputs:
   - Each subagent returns JSON with "applicable_guides" and "not_applicable_guides" arrays
   - Merge all "applicable_guides" arrays into single list
   - Store this as APPLICABLE_GUIDES_DATA (list of objects with guide_path, matched_patterns, total_occurrences)

2. **Output applicable guides summary using <ApplicableGuidesSummary/>:**
   - Sort APPLICABLE_GUIDES_DATA by total_occurrences (highest first)
   - Display formatted list with guide names and occurrence counts
   - This provides visibility into what Pass 2 will analyze

**Handle zero applicable guides edge case:**

If APPLICABLE_GUIDES_DATA is empty (no applicable guides found):
1. Skip Pass 2 entirely
2. Create minimal migration plan at ${MIGRATION_PLAN} stating no guides apply
3. Update TODO: mark "Pass 1" completed, mark "Pass 2" completed (skipped)
4. Jump to PresentResults with appropriate messaging

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="Pass 1: Filter applicable guides (10 parallel subagents)" new_task="Pass 2: Deep analysis (N parallel subagents)"/>

</Pass1_ApplicabilityFilter>

---

<Pass2_DetailedAnalysis>

**Launch N parallel subagents (one per applicable guide):**

From Pass 1, you now have APPLICABLE_GUIDES_DATA - a list of objects containing:
- `guide_path`: Path to the guide file
- `matched_patterns`: Array of {pattern, occurrences} objects showing what matched in Pass 1
- `total_occurrences`: Total occurrence count from Pass 1

**IMPORTANT:** Launch all subagents in a **single message** with multiple Task tool calls for maximum parallelism.

**For each guide in APPLICABLE_GUIDES_DATA:**

Iterate through APPLICABLE_GUIDES_DATA. For each guide object, create a Task tool call with:

**Task description parameter:**
```
"Deep Analysis: ${GUIDE_FILENAME} (${CURRENT_INDEX} of ${TOTAL_COUNT})"
```

Where:
- `${GUIDE_FILENAME}` is the basename of the guide file (e.g., "some_guide.md")
- `${CURRENT_INDEX}` is the 1-based position in APPLICABLE_GUIDES_DATA
- `${TOTAL_COUNT}` is the total number of applicable guides

**Task prompt parameter (substitute values from current guide object):**

```
Deep Analysis Task for ${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}:

You are performing detailed migration analysis for a single Bevy ${VERSION} migration guide.

**Your guide:**
${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}

**Pass 1 Results (use these patterns):**
Matched patterns from Pass 1:
${MATCHED_PATTERNS_JSON}

Expected total occurrences from Pass 1: ${PASS1_TOTAL_OCCURRENCES}

**Your task:**

1. **Read the full guide** from ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}

2. **Verify understanding of technical terminology:**
   - If the guide uses domain-specific terms (e.g., "generic types", "observers", "messages"), look for:
     - Concrete code examples in the guide showing what qualifies
     - Before/after snippets that clarify the meaning
     - Explicit definitions or exclusions
   - When searching the codebase, verify your matches look like the guide's examples
   - If uncertain about a term's meaning:
     - Note your interpretation in the output
     - Include a caveat if matches might need manual review
     - Err on the side of conservative interpretation

   **Example:** If guide says "generic types must still be registered":
   - Check guide for examples of what "generic types" means in this context
   - Look for code snippets showing `Foo<T>` vs `Foo { field: HashMap<K,V> }`
   - Don't assume - verify against the guide's own examples

3. **Inspect code with Pass 1 patterns (for writing diffs):**
   - DO NOT re-extract patterns from the guide
   - Use the EXACT patterns provided in the matched_patterns list above
   - Use rg with context to inspect actual code (needed for writing before/after diffs):
   ```bash
   rg "pattern_from_pass1" --type rust -C 3 "${CODEBASE}"
   ```
   - **DO NOT count manually** - counting happens in step 4
   - This step is ONLY for inspecting code context to write accurate diffs

4. **Count ALL patterns and validate (single step):**

   **STEP A: Construct and declare your exact command**

   First, build your command using this template:
   ```
   ~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_count_pattern.sh --verify --pass1-total [N] --patterns "p1" "p2" "p3" -- "${CODEBASE}" rust
   ```

   Then output this declaration with your EXACT command:
   ```
   I will now run this exact command with ZERO modifications:
   ~/.claude/scripts/bevy_migration_count_pattern.sh --verify --pass1-total [actual number] --patterns [actual patterns] -- [actual path] rust
   ```

   **STEP B: Run the command and immediately describe what you see**

   Copy the EXACT command from Step A and run it. IMMEDIATELY after the Bash tool runs, describe the output you see:

   "The Bash tool shows me this JSON output:
   ```json
   {
     "pass1_total": [number],
     "breakdown": {
       "pattern1": [count],
       "pattern2": [count]
     },
     "pass2_total": [number],
     "variance_percent": [number],
     "status": "[MATCH or ANOMALY]"
   }
   ```"

   You must describe what you SEE in the Bash tool output - do not save to files or redirect.
   If you save to a file, you cannot describe what you see, so just run the command directly.

   **STEP C: Use the output in your analysis**
   - `pass2_total`: Your total occurrence count
   - `breakdown`: Individual pattern counts
   - `status`: "MATCH" (‚â§20% variance) or "ANOMALY" (>20% variance)
   - Include variance explanation if status is "ANOMALY"
   - If pass2_total is 0 but Pass 1 found ${PASS1_TOTAL_OCCURRENCES}, STOP and report error

5. **Classify requirement level:**
   - REQUIRED: Breaking changes that will cause compilation failures
   - HIGH: Deprecated features that still compile but need migration
   - MEDIUM: Optional improvements or new features
   - LOW: Minor changes or optimizations
   - **If 0 occurrences found:** Classify as LOW (informational only)

6. Generate output using <Pass2OutputTemplate/> format
   - In the output, include a link to the guide file: ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}/${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}
   - Use the guide filename (without .md extension) as the title if no title is in the guide
   - **CRITICAL**: Report occurrence counts:
     - Pass 1 Count: ${PASS1_TOTAL_OCCURRENCES}
     - Pass 2 Count: [your actual count]
     - Status: "MATCH" if within 20%, otherwise "ANOMALY: ¬±X%"

**Working directory:** ${CODEBASE}
**Bevy repository:** ${BEVY_REPO_DIR}
**Guide file:** ${GUIDE_FILE_PATH}
```

**Wait for all N subagents to complete:**

Collect markdown sections from each subagent.

**Validate subagent outputs:**

For each section, verify it contains a parseable "**Requirement Level:**" field (REQUIRED/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). If a section is missing this field or has unparseable content, report an error message indicating which guide failed validation and skip that guide with a note in the final plan's "Issues During Analysis" section.

<UpdateTodoProgress old_task="Pass 2: Deep analysis (N parallel subagents)" new_task="Merge and present migration plan"/>

</Pass2_DetailedAnalysis>

---

<MergeMigrationPlan>

**Merge all subagent outputs into final migration plan:**

1. **Create output directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "${CODEBASE}/.claude/bevy_migration"
   ```

2. **Read dependency compatibility output:**

   Use Read tool to read `/tmp/bevy_migration_deps_$(basename ${CODEBASE}).md`.
   Store this content as DEPENDENCY_OUTPUT to insert after the Summary section.

   **Important:** After reading, delete the temp file to prevent stale data in future runs:
   ```bash
   rm -f "/tmp/bevy_migration_deps_$(basename ${CODEBASE}).md"
   ```

3. **Sort sections by requirement level and identify anomalies:**
   - REQUIRED guides first, then HIGH, then MEDIUM, then LOW
   - For each section, parse the occurrence counts from the header:
     - Extract Pass 1 Count and Pass 2 Count values
     - Check Status field for "ANOMALY" markers
   - Track any sections marked with "ANOMALY" status
   - Aggregate list of anomalies for Summary section

4. **Collect literal Pass 2 subagent outputs - NO SUMMARIZATION:**

   **CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
   - Take the EXACT markdown output from EACH Pass 2 subagent response
   - DO NOT summarize, abbreviate, or truncate any subagent output
   - DO NOT substitute references to guide files instead of actual content
   - DO NOT omit diff blocks due to "length concerns"
   - MUST include EVERY numbered change, EVERY diff block, EVERY code snippet from every subagent
   - If a guide has 50 occurrences, ALL 50 must be listed with their specific diffs

   **Collection process:**
   - For each Pass 2 subagent response, extract the complete markdown section starting with "##" and ending with "---"
   - Verify each section contains the full <Pass2OutputTemplate/> structure
   - Group sections by their **Requirement Level:** field (REQUIRED, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Within each group, maintain the sections in their original order

   **Validation:**
   - Count total numbered changes across all sections
   - Verify this matches expected occurrence counts from Summary
   - If any section appears truncated or summarized, REJECT it and report error

4a. **Extract anomaly explanations for detailed reporting:**

   For each guide marked with ANOMALY status (>20% variance):
   - Extract the guide filename (basename only, e.g., "observer_and_event_changes.md")
   - Extract Pass 1 count, Pass 2 count, and variance percentage
   - Look for explanatory text in the Pass 2 subagent output explaining the discrepancy
   - Common explanations to look for:
     - "Pass 1 false positives from..."
     - "Pass 1 counted generic/common terms..."
     - "Pass 2 found additional..."
     - Context about what patterns matched incorrectly in Pass 1
   - Store these as ANOMALY_DETAILS (list of objects with: guide_name, pass1_count, pass2_count, variance_percent, explanation)
   - If no anomalies detected (empty list), this will be used to conditionally omit the Anomaly Analysis section

5. **Generate final document structure:**

```markdown
# Bevy ${VERSION} Migration Plan

**Generated:** [timestamp]
**Codebase:** ${CODEBASE}
**Total Applicable Guides:** [N]

---

## Summary

- **REQUIRED changes:** [X] guides ([Y] total occurrences)
- **HIGH priority:** [X] guides ([Y] total occurrences)
- **MEDIUM priority:** [X] guides ([Y] total occurrences)
- **LOW priority:** [X] guides ([Y] total occurrences)

**Count Anomalies:** [N] guides with >20% variance between Pass 1 and Pass 2
[If N > 0, list them: "- guide_name.md: Pass 1=[X], Pass 2=[Y] (¬±Z%)"]

**Estimated effort:** [Based on occurrence counts]
- REQUIRED: [Large/Medium/Small] (must fix to compile)
- HIGH: [Large/Medium/Small] (should fix soon)
- MEDIUM: [Large/Medium/Small] (optional improvements)
- LOW: [Large/Medium/Small] (nice to have)

---

[If anomalies detected (N > 0), insert the following section:]

## üîç Anomaly Analysis

During the two-pass analysis, [N] guide(s) showed significant variance (>20%) between initial pattern matching and deep contextual analysis:

[For each anomaly, include:]

### [guide_name.md]
- **Pass 1 Count:** [X] occurrences
- **Pass 2 Count:** [Y] occurrences
- **Variance:** ¬±[Z]%
- **Explanation:** [Detailed explanation of why the discrepancy occurred - what Pass 1 patterns matched that weren't actually relevant, or what Pass 2 found that Pass 1 missed]

[End conditional section - omit entire "## üîç Anomaly Analysis" section if N = 0]

---

[Insert DEPENDENCY_OUTPUT content here]

---

## REQUIRED Changes

[Sections from Pass 2 for REQUIRED guides - each section includes **Guide File:** link]

---

## HIGH Priority Changes

[Sections from Pass 2 for HIGH guides - each section includes **Guide File:** link]

---

## MEDIUM Priority Changes

[Sections from Pass 2 for MEDIUM guides - each section includes **Guide File:** link]

---

## LOW Priority Changes

[Sections from Pass 2 for LOW guides - each section includes **Guide File:** link]

---

## Guides Not Applicable to This Codebase

The following [X] guides from Bevy ${VERSION} do not apply to this codebase.

[List file paths from Pass 1 not_applicable_guides arrays - no need to read the files, just list them]

---

## Next Steps

1. Start with REQUIRED changes (must fix to compile with Bevy ${VERSION})
2. Address HIGH priority changes (deprecated features)
3. Consider MEDIUM and LOW priority improvements
4. Test thoroughly after each category of changes
5. Run `cargo check` and `cargo test` frequently

---

## Reference

- **Migration guides directory:** ${GUIDES_DIR}
- **Bevy ${VERSION} release notes:** https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/releases/tag/v${VERSION}
```

6. **Write final migration plan:**

   Use Write tool to create ${MIGRATION_PLAN} with the following structure:
   - Header with metadata (generated timestamp, codebase path, total guides)
   - Summary section with occurrence counts by priority level
   - Anomaly Analysis section (ONLY if ANOMALY_DETAILS is non-empty - include detailed explanations for each anomaly)
   - Dependency compatibility section (content from ${DEPENDENCY_OUTPUT})
   - REQUIRED Changes section (LITERAL COMPLETE Pass 2 markdown sections - ALL diffs, ALL changes)
   - HIGH Priority Changes section (LITERAL COMPLETE Pass 2 markdown sections - ALL diffs, ALL changes)
   - MEDIUM Priority Changes section (LITERAL COMPLETE Pass 2 markdown sections - ALL diffs, ALL changes)
   - LOW Priority Changes section (LITERAL COMPLETE Pass 2 markdown sections - ALL diffs, ALL changes)
   - Guides Not Applicable section (file paths from Pass 1 not_applicable_guides - just list the paths)
   - Next Steps section
   - Reference section (link to ${GUIDES_DIR})

   **Conditional Logic:**
   - If ANOMALY_DETAILS is empty, skip the entire "## üîç Anomaly Analysis" section
   - If ANOMALY_DETAILS has entries, generate the section with one subsection per anomaly

   Concatenate all sections in this order and write to ${MIGRATION_PLAN} using Write tool.

**Note:** The final TODO update happens in PresentResults after displaying the summary.
