# Make a Plan

Create a structured plan document based on our discussion.

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS (name of the new plan document to create in project root)

<ExecutionSteps>
    **EXECUTE THESE STEPS IN ORDER:**

    **STEP 1:** Execute <ShowPlanLocation/>
    **STEP 2:** Execute <SelectPlanType/>
    **STEP 3:** Execute <InteractivePlanBuilding/>
    **STEP 4:** Execute <PlanFinalization/>
</ExecutionSteps>

## STEP 1: SETUP

<ShowPlanLocation>
    Display to user:
    ```
    Creating plan document: [filename from $ARGUMENTS or "plan-[feature-name].md"]
    Location: [project root path]/[filename]
    ```
    Then immediately proceed to Step 2.
</ShowPlanLocation>

## STEP 2: SELECT PLAN TYPE

<SelectPlanType>
    Ask the user:
    ```
    What type of implementation plan would you like to create?
    
    **collaborative** - A plan with step-by-step validation checkpoints where we work together
                       (includes execution protocol for guided implementation)
    
    **agent** - A plan for independent implementation by the coder
              (traditional plan without execution protocol)
    
    Please type: collaborative or agent
    ```
    
    Store the response as PLAN_TYPE for use in subsequent steps.
    
    **Keyword Handling**:
    - "collaborative", "collab", "together" ‚Üí PLAN_TYPE = collaborative
    - "agent", "solo", "independent" ‚Üí PLAN_TYPE = agent
    - Any other response ‚Üí Ask for clarification
</SelectPlanType>

## STEP 3: INTERACTIVE PLAN BUILDING

<InteractivePlanBuilding>
    **Context**: Since we've been discussing this feature/refactoring, use the conversation context to generate intelligent suggestions for each section.

    **IF PLAN_TYPE = collaborative**:
    - First, build the <CollaborativeExecutionProtocol/> section (see definition below)
    - Then proceed with standard sections from <PlanSections/>
    - Ensure Implementation Strategy references the execution protocol
    
    **IF PLAN_TYPE = agent**:
    - Skip <CollaborativeExecutionProtocol/>
    - Proceed with standard sections from <PlanSections/>

    For each section defined in <PlanSections/>:

    1. Present the section name and description from its tagged definition
    2. Generate suggested content based on our discussion so far
    3. **For Problem Statement section specifically**: Before presenting the suggestion, ask user:
       "Are there any specific metrics (file sizes, performance numbers, complexity measures, etc.) we should document as current state? These help establish baselines for measuring success."
    4. **For Migration Strategy section specifically**: 
       - **If PLAN_TYPE = collaborative**: Skip asking - automatically use phased template
       - **If PLAN_TYPE = agent**: Before presenting the suggestion, ask user:
         "Is this change simple enough to be implemented as one conceptual unit (Atomic), or does it require a phased approach with intermediate review points (Phased)? Complex changes affecting multiple systems typically benefit from phased implementation."
    5. Present the suggestion to the user with these options:
       - **accept**: Use the suggested content as-is
       - **revise**: User provides modifications or replacement text
       - **skip**: Omit this section from the plan
       - **expand**: Request more detailed suggestions
    6. Track which sections are included for the final document

    **CRITICAL**: Make suggestions specific and detailed based on what we've discussed. Don't generate generic placeholder content.
</InteractivePlanBuilding>

## STEP 4: FINALIZATION

<PlanFinalization>
    **IF PLAN_TYPE = collaborative**:
    1. Place <CollaborativeExecutionProtocol/> content at the TOP of the document
    2. Follow with all other accepted/revised sections
    3. Ensure Implementation Strategy references the execution protocol steps
    4. Show user a preview of the complete plan structure
    5. Ask for confirmation before writing
    6. Write the plan document to the specified location
    7. Provide summary emphasizing this is a collaborative implementation plan
    
    **IF PLAN_TYPE = agent**:
    1. Compile all accepted/revised sections into final plan document (standard flow)
    2. Show user a preview of the complete plan structure
    3. Ask for confirmation before writing
    4. Write the plan document to the specified location
    5. Provide summary of what was created
</PlanFinalization>

    **Format**:
    ```markdown
    ## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

    <Instructions>
    For each step in the implementation sequence:

    1. **DESCRIBE**: Present the changes with:
       - Summary of what will change and why
       - Code examples showing before/after

       - Expected impact on the system

    2. **AWAIT APPROVAL**: Stop and wait for user confirmation ("go ahead" or similar)

    3. **IMPLEMENT**: Make the changes and stop

    4. **BUILD & VALIDATE**: Execute the build process:
       ```bash
       [project-specific build commands, e.g., cargo build && cargo test]
       ```
       Then inform user to run any necessary reconnection commands

    5. **CONFIRM**: Wait for user to confirm the build succeeded

    6. **TEST** (if applicable): Run validation tests specific to that step

    7. **MARK COMPLETE**: Update this document to mark the step as ‚úÖ COMPLETED

    8. **PROCEED**: Move to next step only after confirmation

    ## Implementation Strategy

    ### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
    **Goal**: [What this phase accomplishes]

    #### Steps:
    1. [Specific action with code example if relevant]
    2. [Specific action with code example if relevant]

    ### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
    [Similar structure]
    ```

    **Format for COLLABORATIVE plans**:
    ```markdown
    ## Implementation Strategy

    **NOTE:** This plan follows the Collaborative Execution Protocol defined above.
    Each phase below corresponds to steps in the INTERACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE.

    ### Phase 1: [Phase Name] ‚Üí See STEP 1 in Execution Protocol
    **Goal**: [What this phase accomplishes]

    #### Steps:
    1. [Specific action with code example if relevant]
    2. [Specific action with code example if relevant]

    ### Phase 2: [Phase Name] ‚Üí See STEP 2 in Execution Protocol
    [Similar structure with references to protocol steps]
    ```

    **Guidelines**:
    - Break into logical phases
    - Include code examples showing changes
    - Specify dependencies between phases
    - Be specific about file modifications
    - **For collaborative plans**: Each phase should map to a step in the execution protocol
</Implementation>

<MigrationStrategy>
    **Section**: Migration Strategy
    **Purpose**: Define whether this is an atomic change or requires phased implementation

    **Format for COLLABORATIVE plans**:
    ```markdown
    ## Migration Strategy

    **Migration Strategy: Phased**

    This collaborative plan uses phased implementation by design. The Collaborative Execution Protocol above defines the phase boundaries with validation checkpoints between each step.

    #### Phase Overview
    Each step in the INTERACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE represents a phase with:
    - User approval before implementation
    - Build validation after changes
    - Explicit confirmation before proceeding

    #### Review Points
    Review points are built into the execution protocol at each step transition.
    ```

    **Format for AGENT plans**:
    ```markdown
    ## Migration Strategy

    **Migration Strategy: [Atomic|Phased]**

    ### [If Atomic]
    This plan represents one conceptual unit that doesn't require backwards compatibility. Even if implemented across multiple commits, we start and work on it until completion without intermediate compatibility layers.

    ### [If Phased - include the following subsections]
    
    #### Phase Overview
    [Brief description of why phased approach is needed]
    
    #### Commit Groups
    **Phase 1**: [Commit Group Name]
    - Commits: [List of related commits]
    - Goal: [What this group accomplishes]
    - Validation: [How to verify this phase works]
    
    **Phase 2**: [Commit Group Name]
    - Commits: [List of related commits]
    - Goal: [What this group accomplishes]
    - Validation: [How to verify this phase works]
    
    #### Review Points
    - After Phase 1: [What to check before proceeding]
    - After Phase 2: [What to check before proceeding]
    ```

    **Guidelines**:
    - Start with clear marker: "**Migration Strategy: Atomic**" or "**Migration Strategy: Phased**"
    - **For Collaborative plans**: Always use "Phased" - the execution protocol inherently creates phases
    - For Atomic: Keep explanation brief - emphasize conceptual unity
    - For Phased: Define clear commit groups with validation points
    - Ensure each phase can compile, build, and test independently
    - Include specific review checkpoints between phases
</MigrationStrategy>
