# Make a Plan

Create a structured plan document based on our discussion.

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS (name of the new plan document to create in project root)

<Persona>
@~/.claude/shared/personas/architect_persona.md

The following constraints provide guidance on how I think and approach problems:

@~/.claude/shared/constraints/design_review_constraints.md
</Persona>

<ExecutionSteps>
    **EXECUTE THESE STEPS IN ORDER:**

    **STEP 0:** Execute <Persona/> to adopt the Software Architect persona
    **STEP 1:** Execute <ShowPlanLocation/>
    **STEP 2:** Execute <SelectPlanType/>
    **STEP 3:** Execute <InteractivePlanBuilding/>
    **STEP 4:** Execute <PlanFinalization/>
</ExecutionSteps>

## STEP 1: SETUP

<ShowPlanLocation>
    Display to user:
    ```
    Creating plan document: [filename from $ARGUMENTS or "plan-[feature-name].md"]
    Location: [project root path]/[filename]
    ```
    Then immediately proceed to Step 2.
</ShowPlanLocation>

## STEP 2: SELECT PLAN TYPE

<SelectPlanType>
    Ask the user:
    ```
    What type of implementation plan would you like to create?
    
    **collaborative** - A plan with step-by-step validation checkpoints where we work together
                       (includes execution protocol for guided implementation)
    
    **agent** - A plan for independent implementation by the coder
              (traditional plan without execution protocol)
    
    Please type: collaborative or agent
    ```

    **STOP** and wait for user response. Do not proceed until valid input received.

    Store the response as PLAN_TYPE for use in subsequent steps.
    
    **Keyword Handling**:
    - "collaborative", "collab", "together" ‚Üí PLAN_TYPE = collaborative
    - "agent", "solo", "independent" ‚Üí PLAN_TYPE = agent
    - Any other response ‚Üí Ask for clarification
</SelectPlanType>

## STEP 3: INTERACTIVE PLAN BUILDING

<InteractivePlanBuilding>
    **Create TodoWrite with sections to process:**
    - Create todos for each section that will be processed based on PLAN_TYPE
    - If PLAN_TYPE = collaborative: Include CollaborativeExecutionProtocol + standard sections
    - If PLAN_TYPE = agent: Include only standard sections from PlanSections
    - Mark each section as 'in_progress' when presenting to user
    - Mark as 'completed' when user makes their choice (accept/revise/skip)
    - Track PLAN_TYPE and section inclusion decisions for final document

    **Context**: Since we've been discussing this feature/refactoring, use the conversation context to generate intelligent suggestions for each section.

    **IF PLAN_TYPE = collaborative**:
    - First, build the <CollaborativeExecutionProtocol/> section (see definition below)
    - Then proceed with standard sections from <PlanSections/>
    - Ensure Implementation Strategy references the execution protocol
    
    **IF PLAN_TYPE = agent**:
    - Skip <CollaborativeExecutionProtocol/>
    - Proceed with standard sections from <PlanSections/>

    For each section defined in <PlanSections/>:

    1. Present the section name and description from its tagged definition
    2. Generate suggested content based on our discussion so far
    3. **For Problem Statement section specifically**: Before presenting the suggestion, ask user:
       "Are there any specific metrics (file sizes, performance numbers, complexity measures, etc.) we should document as current state? These help establish baselines for measuring success."
    4. Present the suggestion to the user with these options:
       - **accept**: Use the suggested content as-is
       - **revise**: User provides modifications or replacement text
       - **skip**: Omit this section from the plan
       - **expand**: Request more detailed suggestions

       **Response Handling**:
       - "accept", "ok", "yes", "use it" ‚Üí accept
       - "revise", "modify", "change", "edit" ‚Üí revise
       - "skip", "omit", "no", "ignore" ‚Üí skip
       - "expand", "more", "detail", "elaborate" ‚Üí expand
       - Any other response ‚Üí Ask for clarification with examples

       **Error Recovery**: If user provides invalid response:
       - Show: "Please respond with one of: accept, revise, skip, or expand"
       - After 2 invalid attempts, inform user: "Defaulting to 'skip' to continue" and proceed

    6. Track which sections are included for the final document

    **CRITICAL**: Make suggestions specific and detailed based on what we've discussed. Don't generate generic placeholder content.
</InteractivePlanBuilding>

## STEP 4: FINALIZATION

<PlanFinalization>
    **IF PLAN_TYPE = collaborative**:
    1. Place <CollaborativeExecutionProtocol/> content at the TOP of the document
    2. Follow with all other accepted/revised sections
    3. Ensure Implementation Strategy references the execution protocol steps
    4. Show user a preview of the complete plan structure
    5. Ask for confirmation before writing
    6. Write the plan document to the specified location
    7. Provide summary emphasizing this is a collaborative implementation plan
    
    **IF PLAN_TYPE = agent**:
    1. Compile all accepted/revised sections into final plan document (standard flow)
    2. Show user a preview of the complete plan structure
    3. Ask for confirmation before writing
    4. Write the plan document to the specified location
    5. Provide summary of what was created
</PlanFinalization>
