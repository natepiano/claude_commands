$ARGUMENTS

If you haven't already read the acknowledgements file in this session:
1. Read `~/.claude/commands/shared/acknowledgements.txt` to learn all the available acknowledgements
2. Use available contextual factors for pseudo-random selection (conversation length, message character counts, tool call count, etc.) - DO NOT use bash commands or system calls
3. Output a single randomly chosen acknowledgement followed by "- proceeding with our agreed course of action."

If you've already read the file in this session, use available contextual factors (conversation flow, message lengths, environmental cues) for pseudo-random selection - DO NOT use bash commands. Output a single randomly chosen acknowledgement followed by "- proceeding with our agreed course of action."

**CRITICAL**: Your response must be ONLY the acknowledgement phrase followed by "- proceeding with our agreed course of action." Nothing else.

Example output: "Roger dodger - proceeding with our agreed course of action."
