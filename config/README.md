Example configuration for the `/blender:bake_textures` command. Copy and modify this template to specify blend files, objects, texture maps, and export settings for texture baking.

## cargo-fmt-exclusions.json

List of crate names to exclude from `cargo fmt` checks. Used when running formatting on external/third-party crates where we don't want to modify their style.
