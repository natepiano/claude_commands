# models-unit: rename-track phases from herdr-unit's plan

> **Production:** sdlc
> **Source:** `docs/plans/herdr-worker-panes.md` on `natedev-herdr` (herdr-unit). sdlc moved these three items to models-unit on 2026-11-02 08:2x EST, on the user's ask to make rename land sooner.

## Delegation Context

- **Project:** `~/.claude` scripts — the agent tooling.
- **Project started:** 2026-11-02T13:25:43.957+00:00
- **Stack:** Python 3.11+ through the `scripts/lib/py` shim, `unittest`, basedpyright; taplo 0.10.
- **Source plan:** read its Delegation Context in `/home/natepiano/worktrees/claude-natedev-herdr/docs/plans/herdr-worker-panes.md`, mainly **Staff design (2026-10-31)**, **One identity join**, **No hard-coded config**, **Rerun-safe tools**, **One file writer** and **Isolation gate**. They apply to every phase here unchanged.
- **Files this unit holds:** `scripts/production/staff_sources.py` and `scripts/production/staff_test_support.py`, for 3k and Phase 4 (sdlc, 2026-11-02).
- **Landing:** each phase lands alone through its own gate.
- **Order (sdlc, 2026-11-02):** Phase 4 is on the rename path (devtools-unit's 3t waits for it); 3k is needed only before herdr 4c. When herdr-unit's 4h merges into `sdlc`, Phase 4 goes ahead of whatever is left of 3k.
- **Test:** `env -u STAFF_OPERATION_FD -u PYTHONUNBUFFERED -u REFUSAL_WATCH_INVENTORY HERDR_BIN=/nonexistent/herdr ~/.claude/scripts/lib/py ~/.claude/scripts/production/merge_gate.py --tests-only --checkout <tree>`, run from `~/.claude` main's copy after a merge of `origin/sdlc`.
- **Lint:** `basedpyright <changed Python files> <every caller module of a changed file>`; pass is `0 errors, 0 warnings`.
- **The four sdlc lines (2026-10-30):** good engineering first; no copies; when many things break the same way, the copy is the cause; fix at the cause.

## Phases

### Phase 3k — `.unit.toml` writers emit taplo-formatted text  · status: done

**Depends on:** herdr Phase 3q (landed). Lands before the configuration-completeness audits (herdr 4c, 4d). Live repair (sdlc, 2026-10-31): the 16:24 fill wrote `.unit.toml` in a format that `taplo fmt --check` rejects under each repository's own `taplo.toml` (`align_entries`, `reorder_keys`).

#### As-built

- `unit_config.write`, `write_parked` and `park` emit the text that `taplo fmt --no-auto-config [--config <file>] --stdin-filepath <path> -` gives, and return `Published | AlreadyCurrent`.
- `_publish` compares formatted bytes, so a file with the right values in the wrong format is rewritten. `_formatted` checks that the formatted text decodes to the same values.
- `repository_formatting(worktree)` reads the repository's `.taplo.toml` or `taplo.toml` into `RepositoryTaploConfig(text)`, else `DefaultTaploConfig`. `UnitConfig.formatting` holds it (`compare=False`); parked files save it under the `taplo_config` key.
- A parked file takes its format from the live recorded start folder's repository config, else its saved `RepositoryTaploConfig`, else the caller's config.
- The staff fill prints `changed` or `unchanged` from the `Published` result, and rewrites existing live configs through `write`. `retirement_plan(..., check_format=...)` checks format only on dry runs.
- A taplo failure raises to the caller; unformatted text is never written.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/unit_config.py` — formatting, `RepositoryTaploConfig`, `DefaultTaploConfig`, `Published | AlreadyCurrent`.
- `scripts/production/staff_sources.py` — fill report and rewrite.
- `scripts/production/unit_config_format_test_support.py` — aligning-config fixtures and a counting taplo wrapper.
- `scripts/production/test_unit_config.py`, `scripts/production/test_staff_sources.py` — tests that run real taplo on writer output.

**Binds later work:** parked files carry `taplo_config`; a reader older than this change rejects that key.

**Gotchas:** `unit_config` calls taplo through its own `run_taplo` alias of `subprocess.run`. `add_unit_test_support` fakes `subprocess.run` for every command that is not git, and the alias keeps that fake away from taplo.

### Phase 4 — Member names come from the staff row  · status: done

**Depends on:** herdr-unit's 4h checkpoint merged into `sdlc`. Must land before devtools-unit starts 3t and before herdr-unit's 4e. After herdr-unit's 3a lands, it also touches `scripts/shutdown/restart.py`.

#### As-built

- `add_unit.py`, `add_showrunner.py` and `resume_unit.py` take the staff row's name for `-n`, the tab title and the pane title.
- `scripts/shutdown/launch_names.py` holds `LaunchNames`: one staff snapshot per restore or restart, rows selected by native resume id, one owner ssh read on the Mac. An unreadable snapshot reuses each saved display name and prints one problem line. A missing row names the entry and keeps its saved name. No row is selected by a saved name.
- `pane_restore.py`, `restart.py` and `stop_resume.py` title a resumed pane and its tab from that snapshot inside `herdr.restore_staff(...)`. An empty name never clears a title. An existing pane is retitled when its tab title is stale, also when its pane label already matches.
- `pane_record.without_legacy_identity` is public; no launch or restart record sets or keeps `STAFF_ID`.
- `herdr.py` drops `STAFF_ID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and `CODEX_THREAD_ID` from every agent environment. `copy_claude_trust` writes through `write_text_atomic(new_file_mode=0o600)`; `atomic_file.write_text_atomic` takes an optional `new_file_mode`.
- `herdr_tab_title.py` resolves a session by its native runtime id. A unit keeps its row name on the tab and pane, and a mismatch prints the `/showrunner:rename_unit` command. Showrunners and workers keep their row titles; a session with no row keeps the ad hoc title. The hook writes no staff row and never stops the turn. It prints the missing-row line only when an incomplete clear is proved.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/add_unit.py`, `add_showrunner.py`, `resume_unit.py` — row names at launch and resume.
- `scripts/shutdown/launch_names.py` — `LaunchNames` and its read states.
- `scripts/shutdown/pane_record.py`, `pane_restore.py`, `restart.py`, `stop_resume.py` — restore names and titles from one snapshot.
- `scripts/herdr/herdr.py`, `scripts/lib/atomic_file.py` — identity-free agent environment; mode for a new atomic file.
- `scripts/hooks/herdr_tab_title.py` — the hand `/rename` rule.
- Tests: `test_add_unit.py`, `test_add_unit_restore.py`, `test_add_showrunner.py`, `test_resume_unit.py`, `test_herdr.py`, `test_atomic_file.py`, `test_herdr_tab_title.py`, `test_pane_record.py`, `test_pane_restore.py`, `test_restart.py`, `test_stop_resume.py`, `test_unit_watchdog.py`.

**Binds later work:** a launched agent gets no identity variable; its identity comes from the native runtime join. Launch titles go in the `NewTab` destination of `herdr.launch_prepared_agent`.

**Gotchas:** `pane_record` must not import `session_staff` (import cycle); `LaunchNames` lives in its own module for that reason. A test that patches `Herdr.retitle` must expect the pane id and the row name.

**Ruled out:** selecting a restore row by its saved name; writing a staff row from the title hook.

### Phase 4m — Port audit: every unit's port is in its `.unit.toml`  · status: done

**Depends on:** herdr-unit's 4h shrink, which writes this Work Order.

#### As-built

- `scripts/production/audit_unit_ports.py` is a read-only audit. For each staff unit row it prints the configuration port, its source path, and the Port cell from the Units row with that document's path. It reads active configuration from the worktree and retired configuration from the parked file, with `cleanup=False`, and remote configuration on the recorded machine. Each result is `AppPort`, `NoAppPort`, `ConfigMissing` or `unavailable: <cause>`; missing configuration never counts as `NoAppPort`. It prints each gap and a `note:` line, supports `--json`, writes nothing, and exits 0 with gaps (tools report anomalies and never block).
- `unit_config` holds the one Port cell parser: `N (note)` is port `N`, and `—` or an empty cell is `NoAppPort`. `production_units.lookup_unit` is the one Units row lookup: it reads the parent's document first, then each showrunner's bound document, with one file cache per run. Its results are `UnitRowFound`, `UnitRowMissing` and `UnitSearchIncomplete`, which keeps each unavailable source. The audit, `staff_sources.py fill` and `add_unit` use both; a new unit never takes another production's port.
- `unit_config.repair_port(target, recorded_old, settled)` is the guarded port repair for `InWorktree` and `Parked` targets. It requires the recorded old value, returns `AlreadyCurrent` for the settled value, refuses any third value and `ConfigMissing`, and publishes through the shared atomic writer under `writer_lock()`. `unit_config.decode` and `unit_config.parked_path(unit, *, home=None)` are public.
- `staff.set_worktree(..., expected=...)` requires the expected old location and compares the full location inside the staff transaction; the settled value returns unchanged. `staff.py set-worktree` takes `--expected-state` with `--expected-machine` and `--expected-path`, and the remote form carries them. Every caller passes the location it observed.
- `staff_sources.py fill` refuses a row on any `UnitSearchIncomplete` result or an unavailable parent document, and names each unread document. Session recovery stays only for `UnitRowMissing`. A refusal is a per-row report; later rows continue.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/audit_unit_ports.py` — the audit command.
- `scripts/production/unit_config.py` — Port cell parser, `repair_port`, `parked_path`, `decode`.
- `scripts/production/production_units.py` — `lookup_unit` and its result types.
- `scripts/production/staff.py` — the guarded `set_worktree` and its CLI.
- `scripts/production/staff_sources.py`, `add_unit.py` — the shared parser and lookup; the incomplete-search refusal.
- `scripts/production/retire_unit.py`, `unit_move.py`, `production_lifecycle.py`, `rename_unit.py` — pass the observed location to `set_worktree`.
- Tests: `test_audit_unit_ports.py`, `test_unit_config.py`, `test_production_units.py`, `test_staff.py`, `test_staff_sources.py`, `test_add_unit.py`, and the shared test-support helpers.

**Binds later work:** every `staff.set_worktree` caller passes `expected=`; `staff.py set-worktree` without the expected flags refuses. Port cells parse only through `unit_config`, and Units rows resolve only through `production_units.lookup_unit`. Readers read `~/.local/state/staff/staff.json` directly; a format change bumps its version and tells cargo-liner.

**Gotchas:** an incomplete search with one match is not proof of one row. The recovery reader must keep the native timer owner when a document load fails, or the refusal loses the document path. A hand-run `staff.py set-worktree` once wrote a phase worktree into a unit row; the expected-old guard now refuses that form.

**Ruled out:** recovering a unit from a live session when the Units search is incomplete; a second Port parser or Units lookup in any caller; an audit that exits 1 on a gap.
