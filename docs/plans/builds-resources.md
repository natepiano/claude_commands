Own what a build may use and when it starts: memory admission and the memory queue, build holds, build targets and slots, the cargo wrapper, and the /tmp and disk sweeps. First work: test_brp_launch_gate.py waits on the live machine's memory under load (natedev, 2026-10-29: module took 169 s, median 6 s; two tests printed 'waiting for memory'). Its setUp fakes BUILDLOG_MEMINFO but not BUILDLOG_MEMORY_PRESSURE. Fake both readings in every test, add a guard that fails a test when the memory gate would read live machine state, and check the other memory-gate callers' tests for the same leak.

## Delegation Context

- **Project:** `~/.claude` — Claude Code commands, docs and Python and shell scripts that run every session. This unit owns what a build may use and when it starts (production doc, Units → Owns).
- **Project started:** 2026-10-29T14:07:00+00:00
- **Stack:** Python 3.13, standard library only; basedpyright strict (`pyrightconfig.json`); unittest. Bash for the memory gate and hooks.
- **Layout:**
  - `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py` — the admission checker. `check_memory_reading(path)` is the tripwire check: with `BUILDLOG_LIVE_MEMORY_TRIPWIRE` set, a path that resolves to `/proc/meminfo` or `/proc/pressure/memory` appends a record and raises `LiveMemoryReading`. `read_meminfo(path)` returns `HostMemory` (`MemAvailable`, `MemTotal`, `SwapTotal`, `SwapFree`); its path comes from the shell (`check <meminfo> …`) or from `BUILDLOG_MEMINFO` (`read_queue`). `read_pressure(host)` reads `BUILDLOG_MEMORY_PRESSURE`, default `/proc/pressure/memory`, and holds every step when `full avg10` > 5, or when swap use is over 85% and `some avg10` is over 25% (Phase 12). The tripwire also protects live cgroup reads; fixtures use `fake_memory_readings`, which includes a private `BUILDLOG_BUILDS_CGROUP`. It swallows `OSError`/`ValueError`. Both call `check_memory_reading` before they open the file. Callers: `check` (in two places) and `read_queue` (the `/build:queue` view). `run_action` (actions include `tripwire <path>`), `main` (a `LiveMemoryReading` exits 2 with its text as the last stderr line).
  - `scripts/lint/memory_gate.sh` — `buildlog_wait_for_memory`. With the tripwire set it resolves `$meminfo` and refuses a live path through `memory_admit.py tripwire <path>`. Then it reads `MemAvailable` itself from `${BUILDLOG_MEMINFO:-/proc/meminfo}` and starts `memory_admit.py check`. A checker that exits non-zero is refused with its last output line (`buildlog_memory_refuse`). On darwin with `BUILDLOG_MEMINFO` unset it grants at once and reads nothing.
  - `scripts/hooks/pre-tool-use-brp-launch-gate.sh` — sources `memory_gate.sh` and calls `buildlog_wait_for_memory` with no arguments (a launch: no reservation).
  - `scripts/hooks/test_brp_launch_gate.py` — `setUp` :53 takes `BUILDLOG_MEMINFO`, `BUILDLOG_MEMORY_PRESSURE` and `BUILDLOG_LIVE_MEMORY_TRIPWIRE` from `fake_memory_readings(self.root)` (:74). `test_low_memory_wait_leaves_old_release_record_unchanged` :159 writes its low value to the returned `meminfo` file.
  - `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — `test_module_environment` :514 gives each test module a private `BUILDLOG_DIR` and the build-tool tripwires (`cargo`, `rustc`, `rustdoc`, `rustup`, `cargo-nextest` first on `PATH`, each appends its argv to `<root>/build-tool-calls.jsonl` and exits 99). `finish_gate_job` reads that file, appends `a test started real <tool>: <args>` to the output, and sets status 1 and `GateJobResult.tripwire_tripped`. The gate never reruns a tripped module alone. Not in any unit's Owns cell: natedev showrunner's file.
  - `scripts/production/affected_modules.py` — affected-only module selection follows import edges (natedev c495a0b2): a change to a test helper selects every module that imports it. There is no `SHARED_TEST_HELPERS` list. natedev showrunner's file.
  - `scripts/production/test_merge_gate_suites.py` — tests of the gate's build-tool tripwire: `test_module_tool_calls_fail_even_when_its_tests_pass` :132 (asserts `a test started real <tool>: <args>` and no `Rerun alone:`), `test_module_can_put_its_own_build_tool_stub_first` :145. natedev 367da4f1 split `test_merge_gate.py` by subject into this module, `test_merge_gate_holds.py` and `test_merge_gate_ledger.py`. natedev showrunner's file.
  - Import idiom for a test helper: `from scripts.lib.nix_env_test_support import NixFixture` (`scripts/direct/test_verify_nix_shell.py` :13); the gate runs each module with the repo root as working directory.
- **Survey (2026-10-29, `grep -c` per test module that names the gate, `invoke.sh`, `verify.sh` or the launch hook):**
  - Fake both readings: `scripts/lint/test_memory_admit.py`, `scripts/build_queue/test_build_queue.py`, `scripts/hooks/test_brp_launch_gate.py`, `scripts/build_hold/test_build_hold.py` (this unit, through `fake_memory_readings`); `scripts/direct/test_verify_mac_offload.py` and `test_verify_checks_fail_closed.py` (through `verify_mac_offload_test_support.py` :682), `test_verify_lint_scope.py` (`verify_lint_scope_test_support.py` :244), `test_verify_token_wait.py` (`verify_token_wait_test_support.py` :156), `test_verify_untested_examples.py` (:190) (verify-unit).
  - Fake `BUILDLOG_MEMINFO` but not `BUILDLOG_MEMORY_PRESSURE` (pressure leaks), checked on the worktree tree after merge 73a8d903: `scripts/buildlog/test_record.py` (report-unit); `scripts/buildlog/test_mac_idle.py` :333, `scripts/direct/test_verify_doc.py` :137, `test_verify_release_ack.py` :83 (verify-unit); `scripts/production/test_dailies_render_holds.py` :124, :255 (natedev showrunner).
  - Fake `BUILDLOG_MEMORY_PRESSURE` but not `BUILDLOG_MEMINFO`: `scripts/direct/test_verify_hold_wait.py` (verify-unit) — the meminfo read may be stubbed; the tripwire decides.
  - Fake neither but run `verify.sh`, `invoke.sh` or the gate: about 30 more modules (`scripts/direct/test_verify_memory_kill.py`, `test_verify_final_pass.py`, `test_verify_nix_shell.py`, `scripts/hooks/test_build_hold_guard.py`, `scripts/build_hold/test_hold_enforcer.py`, `scripts/lint/test_invoke_scope.py` and others). Many stub the gate or stop before it; a static count cannot tell, so Phase 2 uses the tripwire to find the set.
- **Out of scope (unit director's call, 2026-10-29; a one-line change to the tripwire if wrong):** the process table (`BUILDLOG_PROC`, `process_start_time`). The gate reads it only for the pids that the test's private ledger names, so machine load cannot change an admission through it. The build budget is a constant unless `BUILDLOG_BUILD_BUDGET_GIB` is set: not live.
- **Test lanes:** `test_*.py` beside each module.
- **Build:** none (Python, shell and markdown).
- **Test:** each changed module with `python3 -m unittest discover -s <dir> -p '<module>'` from the worktree root. Then the merge gate: `env HERDR_BIN=/nonexistent/herdr python3 ~/.claude/scripts/production/merge_gate.py --checkout <worktree> --tests-only`, run from `~/.claude` main after a merge of `origin/builds` (memory: merge origin before every gate). Check `build_hold.py status` first; no tests during a natedev build hold that this unit does not hold.
- **Lint:** `basedpyright scripts/lint scripts/hooks scripts/build_hold scripts/production` from the worktree root, plus the directory of every other changed module; pass is its `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes` line (exit status says nothing). `bash -n scripts/lint/memory_gate.sh`.
- **Invariants:**
  - Admission and hold check errors stop the step; only an explicit admission answer starts it (`docs/as-built/build-memory-admission.md` → Invariants).
  - Outside a test the tripwire does nothing: it acts only when `BUILDLOG_LIVE_MEMORY_TRIPWIRE` is set, and no installed caller sets it. A live session's gate behaves as before, byte for byte in its output.
  - Tests never read the real cgroup tree, `/proc/meminfo` or `/proc/pressure/memory` (as-built Invariants; this plan adds the pressure file).
  - Files of other owners go through cargo-berth's normal flow, and the checkpoint notice names each owner: `also touches <paths> (owner <unit>), tested against <owner origin tip>, clean` (production rule, Owners in natedev).
  - All text uses Simplified Technical English (user, 2026-10-18).

## Phases

### Phase 1 — A tripwire for live memory readings, and the BRP launch tests fake both  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- **Tripwire.** `BUILDLOG_LIVE_MEMORY_TRIPWIRE` holds a record file path. When it is set and not empty, a memory reading whose path resolves (`os.path.realpath`; bash `realpath -m`) to `/proc/meminfo` or `/proc/pressure/memory` is not read: it appends one JSON line `{"reading": "<live path>", "argv": [...], "pid": <pid>}` under `fcntl.flock` and stops the caller with `live memory reading <live path> in a test; fake BUILDLOG_MEMINFO and BUILDLOG_MEMORY_PRESSURE (scripts/lint/memory_test_support.py)`. A failed record write still refuses. Unset or empty, every reading is unchanged.
- **Python.** `memory_admit.py` `check_memory_reading(path)` runs before `read_meminfo` and `read_pressure` open their file and raises `LiveMemoryReading` (a `RuntimeError`, so `read_pressure`'s `OSError`/`ValueError` handler does not swallow it). The CLI action `tripwire <path>` runs the same check. `main` wraps `run_action` and turns `LiveMemoryReading` into exit 2 with the text as its last stderr line; in-process callers (`read_queue`, tests) get the exception.
- **Shell.** `memory_gate.sh` `buildlog_wait_for_memory` resolves `$meminfo` before its `MemAvailable` read; a live path goes to `memory_admit.py tripwire`, which writes the record, and the gate refuses with its last line and returns 2. The darwin early grant stays first and reads nothing.
- **Fake helper.** `scripts/lint/memory_test_support.py` `fake_memory_readings(root: Path, *, available_kib: int = 67108864, total_kib: int = 67108864, full_avg10: float = 0.0) -> dict[str, str]` writes `root/"meminfo"` and `root/"pressure"` and returns `BUILDLOG_MEMINFO`, `BUILDLOG_MEMORY_PRESSURE` and `BUILDLOG_LIVE_MEMORY_TRIPWIRE`. An inherited tripwire value stays in use (an empty value stays empty); `root/"live-memory-reads.jsonl"` applies only when the variable is absent. A test that changes a reading rewrites the returned files.
- **Tests.** `test_brp_launch_gate.py` and `test_build_hold.py` take their memory variables from the helper; a launch with the tripwire set and pressure unfaked is denied with the `/proc/pressure/memory` text. `test_memory_admit.py` sets the tripwire module-wide and tests the Python, symlink, queue, unwritable-record and shell refusals, fake readings that admit with no record, and live behavior with the tripwire unset.

**Files:**
- `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py` — `LiveMemoryReading`, `check_memory_reading`, the `tripwire` action, `main`.
- `scripts/lint/memory_gate.sh` — the live-path check before the `MemAvailable` read.
- `scripts/lint/memory_test_support.py` — `fake_memory_readings`.
- `scripts/lint/test_memory_admit.py`, `scripts/hooks/test_brp_launch_gate.py`, `scripts/build_hold/test_build_hold.py` — the helper and the tripwire tests.
- `docs/as-built/build-memory-admission.md` — the tests invariant names both readings and the helper; the tripwire; the unfaked-pressure gotcha.

**Binds later work:** the `fake_memory_readings` signature and its inherited-tripwire rule; the refusal text; the record line shape (a JSON object, not an argv list); the gate that fails a tripped module reads only recorded lines.

**Gotchas:**
- A shell-side record's `argv` names the checker (`memory_admit.py tripwire <path>`), not the test process.
- Tests that trip on purpose use a private record path, never the inherited one.
- `test_default_pressure_still_returns_pressure_when_tripwire_is_unset_or_empty` reads live `/proc/pressure/memory` by design.
- Module selection follows import edges (`affected_modules.py`), so a change to `memory_test_support.py` selects every module that imports it; there is no shared-helper list.

**Ruled out:** a second JSON/flock writer in bash (the shell delegates to `memory_admit.py tripwire`); the process table in the tripwire (the gate reads only the pids the test's ledger names).

### Phase 2 — The merge gate sets the tripwire for every test module, and every caller's tests fake both readings  · status: done

#### As-built

- `test_module_environment` sets `BUILDLOG_LIVE_MEMORY_TRIPWIRE=<module tmp>/live-memory-reads.jsonl` for every test module. The `types` suite gets no tripwire.
- `finish_gate_job` reads that file. Each line is `{"reading": <path>, "argv": [...], "pid": <pid>}` and adds `<module>: a test read live memory <reading>: <args>` to the output and sets status 1. A line that does not parse also trips the module, with its raw text in the output.
- `GateJobResult.tripwire_tripped` (was `build_tool_started`) is true for a build-tool call or a live memory reading. A tripped module is not rerun alone, and the hold retry keeps the result.
- The five pressure-only leaks (`test_record.py`, `test_mac_idle.py`, `test_verify_doc.py`, `test_verify_release_ack.py`, `test_dailies_render_holds.py`) fake both readings with `fake_memory_readings`. No other module in the suite reads live memory.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — tripwire environment, record read, tripped result.
- `scripts/production/test_merge_gate_suites.py` — unit and end-to-end tripwire tests.
- `scripts/buildlog/test_record.py`, `scripts/buildlog/test_mac_idle.py`, `scripts/direct/test_verify_doc.py`, `scripts/direct/test_verify_release_ack.py`, `scripts/production/test_dailies_render_holds.py` — fake both readings.
- `docs/as-built/merge-gate-and-test-speed.md`, `docs/as-built/build-memory-admission.md` — the tripwire, its two limits, and the shipped floor sweep order.

**Binds later work:** every test module runs under the tripwire in the merge gate, so a new test fakes both readings with `fake_memory_readings` or fails the gate. A test that trips on purpose uses a private record path, never the inherited one.

**Gotchas:**
- `test_memory_admit.py` `test_default_pressure_still_returns_pressure_when_tripwire_is_unset_or_empty` reads live pressure with the tripwire removed, by design.
- A reading whose record write fails still refuses but leaves no record. The gate sees only recorded readings.
- A shell-side read records through `memory_admit.py tripwire <path>`, so `argv` names the checker, not the test. The output line takes the module name from the job.

**Ruled out:** module medians from `/build:report`, which has no module rows; the merge gate's own timing history is the source.

### Phase 3 — The floor sweep keeps build output that is in use  · status: done

#### As-built

- `hold_floor` in `scripts/lint/sweep.py` orders every idle target by last use, oldest first. Last use is the newer of the `.lint-sweep-used` stamp and the fingerprint atimes. No `/tmp` target goes first. A target used within `recent_minutes` (`[sweep]` in `config/lint.conf`, default 60) is taken only when older targets cannot meet the floor. The per-target budget sweep uses the same order.
- The floor pass plans without a lock. It then takes each target's cargo lock without blocking, one target at a time, skips a busy target, and stops when the shortfall is met. The floor-root scan runs on 4 threads (202 s to 123 s).
- Each floor and budget take appends a line to `~/.local/state/lint-sweep/removals.jsonl`. Past 1 MiB, the file is cut to the newest 512 KiB. `sweep.py rebuilds --days N` reads this record and the build log. For each step with `crates_compiled >= 50`, it names the cause of the cold rebuild (`floor take`, `budget take`, `tmp sweep`, `none`) and prints compile-hours per cause and clone kind. It writes nothing.

**Files:**
- `scripts/lint/sweep.py` — floor and budget sweeps, per-target locks, removal record, `rebuilds` report.
- `scripts/lint/test_sweep.py` — order, lock, removal record and rebuild tests.
- `config/lint.conf` — `[sweep]` keep window and scan thread settings.
- `docs/as-built/build-targets.md` — the sweep order, `recent_minutes` and `rebuilds`.

**Binds later work:**
- The shared-folder sweep extension: `sweep.py` keys use by workspace and finds clone kind from the path (gate or merge, `/tmp/claude/scratch`, phase). A folder shared by many clones is one target with many users; the keep window and the per-target lock (the cargo build-dir lock) cover all of them, and `rebuilds` attributes by clone path.
- The typed reclamation split shipped in Phase 9 (`ReclamationEstimate`, `ConfirmedDeletion`, `reclaim`); a hard link outside the target now frees nothing.
- The tmp_sweep memory phase: the `sweep.py` floor scan now runs 4 threads, so a working-set reading of `sweep.py` must come from this code.
- The clone cache trial uses `sweep.py rebuilds` for its before/after cold compile-hours per clone kind.

**Gotchas:**
- Unlinking one hard-linked copy changes the shared inode's ctime. Output identity is (dev, ino, size, mtime), never ctime.
- `freed_by()` runs only on a dry run, through `reclaim()`; a real run credits the `ConfirmedDeletion` that `remove()` returns (Phase 9).

**Ruled out:** a first-builds column in `rebuilds`; the shared-folder sweep extension computes first builds from build-log records.

### Phase 4 — Short-lived clones share one build folder per repository  · status: todo
**Depends on:** Phase 3, Phase 9 (the sweep change this phase extends), and the case D numbers from verify-unit's Phase 1 trial (the user approved verify-unit's copy plan on 2026-10-29; case D runs under verify's build hold after 00:00 EDT). The adopt rule picks this phase or drops it.

#### Work Order

**Goal:** a new temp clone of a Rust repository reuses the build output of earlier clones of the same repository, if a measured trial shows that this saves work without making builds wait. Approved by the showrunner 2026-10-29 (W2). Measurement: mktemp folders (91.2 compile-h in 7 days, 4.6 steps per clone, 61.6 cold-h on first builds) and style-sync folders (10.9 h) rebuild everything on their first build.

**Spec:**

1. **Trial first.** (Showrunner, 2026-10-29: if the user approves verify-unit's copies plan, this trial runs as case D of verify's Phase 1, in the same build-hold session, so its numbers compare with the seeding cases. The build work in items 3-5 waits on the pick that plan's rule makes from those numbers.) On hana, make two clones at one commit with `scratch.py new`. Build the first, then the second with a shared `CARGO_BUILD_BUILD_DIR` per repository. Record crates compiled and wall time for each. Then run two builds at once on the shared build folder and record the lock wait. Use `verify.sh build` for every build. `verify.sh` serializes calls that share a unit board, so start the two parallel builds from two separate session folders, and record each Cargo start and end time: the phase report shows that the two Cargo runs overlap. Report the build-folder lock wait (Cargo's `Blocking waiting for file lock` time) apart from the admission wait and the board wait.
2. **Adopt rule.** Adopt only when the second build compiles under half the crates of the first, and the parallel lock wait is under 10% of build time. Otherwise the phase records the numbers in the plan, changes no code, and stops.
3. **If adopted:**
   - `scripts/lib/scratch.py`: `new()` (:182) makes a task-owned folder today; it does not clone and takes no repository. Add an explicit clone operation (repository, commit, destination) that sets the shared build folder for that repository. Name the exact command in the as-built.
   - `scripts/hooks/pre-tool-use-scratch-guard.py` steers a hand clone of a Rust repository into `/tmp` or a scratchpad to that clone operation.
   - `scripts/style/style_sync.py` already shares one `style-sync-target` per repository (:332) and serializes checkout creation through cleanup. Change only what the shared-folder lifetime needs, and keep its lock.
   - **Shared-target identity.** One mapping from repository to its shared folder. The folder has one use stamp for all its clones, a lifetime that does not end with one scratch task, and Cargo's build-folder lock. `rebuild_causes()` today finds a workspace by the target's parent path; give it the mapping, so a removal of the shared folder names the repository.
   - The disk sweeps treat the shared build folder as one target with its own last use. `lock_trees()` (sweep.py :491) returns `TargetLocksAcquired | TargetLockBusy`, not `tuple[list[int], str | None]`.
   - Deletions of the shared folder go through `reclaim()` and count only `ConfirmedDeletion` bytes (Phase 9). Artifacts that Cargo hard-links into a clone's own target folder free nothing while that clone is present; a test in `test_sweep.py` covers a shared folder whose artifacts are still linked from a clone.
4. **Tests** for each changed module, in `scripts/lib/test_scratch.py`, `scripts/hooks/test_scratch_guard.py`, `scripts/style/test_style_sync.py` and `scripts/lint/test_sweep.py`: two clones on one target, a busy shared target, and rebuild attribution after its removal. The existing busy-skip and exhaustion tests stay as gates.
5. **Docs.** The scratch as-built names the shared build folder and the guard's steer.

**Files:**
- `scripts/lib/scratch.py` — item 3.
- `scripts/lib/test_scratch.py` — item 4.
- `scripts/hooks/pre-tool-use-scratch-guard.py` — item 3.
- `scripts/hooks/test_scratch_guard.py` — item 4.
- `scripts/style/style_sync.py` — item 3 (owner natedev style-unit; trial-merge against `origin/natedev`).
- `scripts/lint/sweep.py` — item 3, the shared folder as one target.
- `scripts/lint/test_sweep.py`, `scripts/style/test_style_sync.py` — item 4.

**Workers:** `1 writer + 1 tester`
- `impl` — the trial (item 1), the adopt decision record, items 3 and 5.
- `test` — item 4, after the adopt decision: `test_scratch.py`, `test_scratch_guard.py`, `test_style_sync.py`, `test_sweep.py`.

**Acceptance gate:**
- The trial numbers (crates compiled, wall time, lock wait) are in the phase report with the adopt decision.
- If adopted: the tests of each changed module pass; `basedpyright` over each changed file reports `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes`. Post-merge check, 24 h after the merge reaches main (as in Phase 12's ruling): the first-build cold-h of mktemp and scratch.py folders, next to the 7-day figures. `rebuilds` does not separate first builds (a workspace's first step has cause `none`), so compute it from the build-log records: the first recorded step of each new workspace folder. The removal records in `rebuilds` name the shared folder's repository. The phase report records when the check is due; the result goes in a follow-up notice.
- The notice has an `also touches scripts/style/style_sync.py (owner natedev style-unit)` line, tested against `origin/natedev`.
- Change-Review line: a new temp clone of hana builds only the crates that changed | in any Claude session on natedev, make two clones of hana at one commit with the scratch.py clone command that Spec 3 adds (its exact form is in the scratch as-built) and build each with `verify.sh build` | the second clone's build log step compiles under half the crates of the first.

### Phase 5 — Clone builds turn incremental mode off, and mend uses the compile cache  · status: todo
**Depends on:** Phase 3; Phase 12 (`invoke.sh`).

#### Work Order

**Goal:** builds in temp clones store their workspace crates in sccache, and mend uses sccache, if a measured trial shows hits. Approved by the showrunner 2026-10-29 (W3). Measurement: workspace crates build with `-C incremental`, so sccache never caches them; mend runs with `RUSTC_WRAPPER=` (`scripts/lint/invoke.sh:582`), 31.6 cold-h in `/tmp` this week; sccache is full at 64 of 64 GiB.

**Spec:**

1. **Trial first.** Two hana clones at one commit. Build both with `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` and record sccache hits for workspace crates on the second (stats before and after). invoke.sh :578-579 says a cache hit suppresses the rustc diagnostics that mend reads. Test that claim: run mend twice with sccache in a clone, and compare the findings of the cached second run with a run that has `RUSTC_WRAPPER=`.
2. **Adopt rule.** Adopt each change only on a measured gain: workspace-crate hits on the second clone, or a shorter mend run with the same mend findings. The baseline is dated after Phase 3 (`e3b8e391`), so a sweep gain is not counted as a cache gain. The trial is case E in verify-unit's build hold (showrunner, 2026-10-29).
3. **If adopted:** `scripts/direct/verify.sh` sets `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` for builds in a temp clone (not in `~/rust` worktrees, where incremental helps); `scripts/lint/invoke.sh` runs mend with sccache.
4. **sccache size and disk room.** Report the full cache and the disk numbers to natedev, which decides the cache size and the disk room as root.
5. **Tests** in the new `scripts/direct/test_verify_clone_incremental.py` for the `verify.sh` lines, and in `scripts/lint/test_invoke_scope.py` (owner verify-unit) for the `invoke.sh` lines.

**Files:**
- `scripts/direct/verify.sh` — item 3 (owner verify-unit; trial-merge against `origin/natedev-verify` and `origin/natedev`).
- `scripts/lint/invoke.sh` — item 3 (owner verify-unit; same trial merges).
- `scripts/direct/test_verify_clone_incremental.py` — new — item 5, the tests for the changed `verify.sh` lines (a new module, so verify-unit's own test modules stay untouched).
- `scripts/lint/test_invoke_scope.py` — item 5, the tests for the changed `invoke.sh` lines (owner verify-unit).

**Workers:** `1 writer + 1 tester`
- `impl` — the trial, the adopt decision record, item 3, the item 4 message text for the director.
- `test` — item 5, after the adopt decision.

**Acceptance gate:**
- The trial numbers are in the phase report with each adopt decision.
- If adopted: the changed modules' tests pass; `basedpyright` over every changed Python file reports `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes`; the notice has `also touches` lines for verify.sh and invoke.sh (owner verify-unit), tested against `origin/natedev-verify` and `origin/natedev`.
- Change-Review line: temp-clone builds and mend runs reuse the compile cache | in a terminal on natedev, `sccache --show-stats` before and after a second clone's build | the Rust hit count rises by the workspace crates of the second build.

### Phase 6 — The BRP launch gate keeps waiting for every launch; the bypass moves to Phase 13  · status: done

#### As-built

- Showrunner ruling B, 2026-10-29 18:13 EDT: ship "every launch waits". There is no bypass and no build record. `scripts/direct/verify.sh` does not change.
- Rounds 1–3 built a freshness check in the hook: a build record from `verify.sh`'s build step, dep-info times, flags and features. Pass 3 found four more edges: feature-name normalization, `env!` and env-dep variables, build-script rerun-if inputs, and a race when the record is published. An Astra design review found that a freshness copy in the hook can never be certain: the hook's environment is not the environment of the MCP server whose cargo BRP runs.
- Result: no code change. The hook stays as Phase 1 left it: every `mcp__brp__brp_launch` call runs the build-hold check (`check-local`) and then `buildlog_wait_for_memory`. The Phase 1 fake memory readings and tripwire tests stay. The bypass diff stays in the run folder (`phases/6/bypass_round3.patch`) for Phase 13.

**Files:** none changed.

**Binds later work:** Phase 13 adds the bypass only through a bevy_brp prebuilt-only launch mode. A freshness check in the hook and a build record are ruled out.

### Phase 7 — A one-line command summarizes the machine's working set, and the disk-floor sweep uses less memory  · status: done
**Depends on:** Phase 3

#### As-built

- `scripts/build_targets/working_set.py` prints memory by category from `/proc`: cargo/rustc, Claude sessions, Codex, Python helpers and other. The Python row breaks down by script path and names the owning unit. Each row gives PSS, swap and its top three processes. The machine totals are total, available and swap used. The script writes nothing. A process that is unreadable or that exited is counted on its own line.
- Owner rules come from `scripts/build_targets/working_set_owners.json`, generated from the production docs' Owns cells (73 rules, 13 units at checkpoint; 69 rules, 12 units since the retired enh-showrunner rows dropped out). `load_owners` validates the file; a bad file exits 1 and names the file. The rules are not in the script, because the push-text gate read an owner tuple that named `pushover.py` as a phone send.
- Argv parsing finds the entry point past interpreter options, Node runtime options included. `node --redirect-warnings` is a known gap (follow-up add-on).
- `scripts/lint/tmp_sweep.py` streams its scan. The process-use boundary returns `ProcessUsesKnown | ProcessUsesUnavailable`. `scripts/lint/folder_audit.py` uses the same types.
- Measured on natedev 2026-10-29: `working_set.py` ran in 1.25 s, and its available and swap totals matched `free -m`. `tmp_sweep.py --dry-run` over the live `/tmp` peaked at 36 MB (was 1.3–3.9 GB).
- The `working-set` PATH wrapper is natedev's change in `/etc/nixos/modules/common/agents.nix`, after this reaches main.

**Files:**
- `scripts/build_targets/working_set.py` — new — the category table, the owner lookup and the argv parsing.
- `scripts/build_targets/test_working_set.py` — new — tests on a fixture `/proc` tree, owner file checks and argv forms.
- `scripts/build_targets/working_set_owners.json` — new — the owner rules generated from the production docs' Owns cells.
- `scripts/lint/tmp_sweep.py` — the streamed scan and the typed process-use result.
- `scripts/lint/test_tmp_sweep.py` — tests for the streamed scan and both process-use results.
- `scripts/lint/folder_audit.py` — the same process-use types; an unavailable process scan keeps a due folder.
- `scripts/lint/test_folder_audit.py` — tests for a known empty and an unavailable process-use result, a kept due folder and the lsof fallback.

**Binds later work:** A new script whose owner must show in the table needs an Owns entry in its production doc. Regenerate `working_set_owners.json` from the production docs after an Owns cell changes.

### Phase 8 — Shared build state is written only by the installed copy  · status: todo
**Depends on:** Phase 2; Phase 5 (`verify.sh`, `invoke.sh`); Phases 10, 12 and 11 (`memory_admit.py`, its tests and doc); report-unit's bare-step writer in `waiter_identity` (merged at HEAD 64a94048)

**Approved:** showrunner 2026-10-29, after Phase 2. report-unit keeps its bare-step writer (it fixes the cause in main) and drops only its read-side strip; this phase builds the repository field on report-unit's merge. The edit to `builds-production.md:14` is approved.

#### Work Order

**Goal:** the showrunner's ruling (2026-10-29 13:15, on the user's word that the current state is a bad design): shared coordination code (memory gate, queue rows, holds) writes shared state from one installed copy, `~/.claude` main. Every caller runs that copy, never its own checkout's. Tests keep their fakes. Queue rows carry the repository and the step as separate fields.

Measured 2026-10-29 13:20 EDT (read-only survey of `/proc` and `~/.local/state/buildlog/admission`):
- All 19 live `.waiting` rows carry the combined label ("hana clippy"). Main's own `memory_admit.py` writes it (`waiter_identity`, `"step": f"{repo} {step}"`, rewritten by the held-poll write in `check`). The 13 `.reservation` rows already keep `repo` and `step` apart. So the old format is main's writer, not an old copy.
- The read-side prefix strip is not in main. It is an uncommitted change in report-unit's worktree (`scripts/lint/memory_admit.py` :1126–1128 strip, :1068–1071 bare-step writer).
- Checkout copies that run today: `verify.sh`'s relative lookups in the `override_guard.sh` source line, `LOCAL_RELEASE_WAIT_SCRIPT` (`local_release_wait.py`, loads `scripts.build_hold` from its own tree), `MESH_RUNS_SCRIPT` (`mesh_runs.py`), `MAC_IDLE_SCRIPT` (`mac_idle.py`, writes Mac-idle markers) and the `BUILD_TARGETS_SCRIPT` fallback; `memory_gate.sh:26` names `memory_admit.py` beside itself with no override; `merge_gate.py:52,59` imports `build_hold` from the copy that runs (it reads holds only); `scripts/message/top_level.py:80` and `scripts/production/retire_unit.py:75-79` write holds through the copy that runs. One live checkout `verify.sh` (claude-build-followups-verify, real `HOME`, no fake dirs) held a queue row at 13:20.
- Already main by registration: the BRP launch hook, the build-hold hook, the `cargo` wrapper, `/build:queue`.

**Spec:**

1. **The writers refuse a checkout copy.** `memory_admit.py` and `build_hold.py` refuse to write the real state directories (`~/.local/state/buildlog/admission`, the real hold dir) when their own file is not the installed copy under `~/.claude/scripts/`. With a fake `BUILDLOG_DIR` / `BUILD_HOLD_DIR` (every test), they write as now. The refusal names the installed path to run instead. This one guard is the fix at the cause; items 2–4 make every caller pass it.
2. **Queue rows carry separate fields.** report-unit's merged writer already gives `.waiting` rows a bare `step`; this phase adds the `repository` field beside it, as `.reservation` rows carry `repo`. The queue view's reader takes the fields; no prefix strip exists anywhere. `build_queue.py` shows the repository beside the step for waiting and running rows alike (report-unit's file; its one display change only).
3. **Callers run the installed copy.**
   - `memory_gate.sh`: `BUILDLOG_MEM_ADMIT_SCRIPT="${BUILDLOG_MEM_ADMIT_SCRIPT:-$HOME/.claude/scripts/lint/memory_admit.py}"`. `invoke.sh:89` sources `$HOME/.claude/scripts/lint/memory_gate.sh`.
   - `verify.sh`: one root, `SCRIPTS="$HOME/.claude/scripts"`, for `override_guard.sh`, `local_release_wait.py`, `mesh_runs.py`, `mac_idle.py` and the `build_targets` fallback. Tests fake `HOME` with a copied tree already; the `VERIFY_*_SCRIPT` overrides stay.
   - `merge_gate.py` reads holds only and already runs from `~/.claude` main (Delegation Context, Test). No change. The notice records this.
   - `top_level.py`, `retire_unit.py`: the `build_hold.py` path from `Path.home() / ".claude"`.
4. **The plan lines that teach a checkout run** (`docs/plans/builds-production.md:14`, `docs/plans/build-followups-worker-seats.md:48`) name `~/.claude/scripts/lib/py ~/.claude/scripts/production/merge_gate.py --checkout <tree>`.
5. **Tests:** `scripts/build_hold/override_guard.py` already finds the real home through the account database and refuses fake state variables when the installed script runs. Keep that refusal. Routing tests copy scripts under a fake home; the checkout-write refusal is tested against an injected canonical-home and state fixture, never real coordination state. A checkout-copy `memory_admit.py` against the real-dir path refuses (exit 2, named reason) and against a fake dir writes; same for `build_hold.py`; a `.waiting` row has `repository` and a bare `step`; the queue view shows both; `verify.sh` and `memory_gate.sh` resolve to `$HOME/.claude/scripts` under a fake `HOME`. Fake memory readings throughout (Phase 1 helper).

**Files:**
- `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py`, `scripts/lint/memory_gate.sh`, `scripts/lint/test_memory_admit.py` — items 1–2, 3, 5.
- `scripts/build_hold/build_hold.py`, `scripts/build_hold/test_build_hold.py` — items 1, 5.
- `scripts/build_queue/build_queue.py`, `scripts/build_queue/test_build_queue.py` — item 2 (owner report-unit).
- `scripts/direct/verify.sh`, `scripts/lint/invoke.sh` — item 3 (owner verify-unit). The tester owns routing coverage in `scripts/direct/test_verify_checks_fail_closed.py`, `scripts/direct/test_verify_nix_shell.py`, `scripts/lint/test_invoke_scope.py`, `scripts/message/test_top_level.py` and `scripts/production/test_retire_unit.py`, plus the admission, hold and queue tests named above. Cover the installed paths and retained overrides under a fake HOME and private coordination state.
- `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — no change (item 3); the notice records why.
- `scripts/message/top_level.py`, `scripts/production/retire_unit.py` — item 3 (owners per natedev's Owners table, named in the notice).
- `docs/plans/builds-production.md`, `docs/plans/build-followups-worker-seats.md` — item 4.
- `docs/as-built/build-memory-admission.md` — the one-copy rule and the row fields.

**Workers:** `1 writer + 1 tester`
- `impl` — items 1–4 and the doc.
- `test` — item 5.

**Acceptance gate:**
- The changed modules' tests pass; `basedpyright` over every changed Python file reports `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes`.
- Live, after install: every `.waiting` row in `~/.local/state/buildlog/admission` has `repository` and a bare `step` within one held poll; a run of a checkout copy's `memory_admit.py` against the real dir exits 2 with the named refusal.
- The notice has `also touches` lines for verify.sh and invoke.sh (verify-unit, against `origin/natedev-verify` and `origin/natedev`), the hold callers (their owners, against `origin/natedev`), and build_queue.py (report-unit, against `origin/builds-report`); it confirms no read-side prefix strip remains in `memory_admit.py` or `build_queue.py`.
- Change-Review line: `/build:queue` shows the repository and the step in separate columns | in a Claude session on natedev while a build waits, type `/build:queue` | each row shows e.g. `hana` and `clippy` apart, and no row reads "hana clippy".

### Phase 9 — The floor sweep counts what a deletion really frees  · status: done

#### As-built

- `scripts/lint/sweep.py` keeps two typed counts apart. `ReclamationEstimate(bytes)` comes from the scan's link counts: `freed_by()` returns it, before any deletion. `ConfirmedDeletion(bytes, failures)` comes from the deletion: `remove()` returns it, summed from each unlink.
- `remove_entry_at()` reads `os.lstat` just before each unlink. A file's blocks (`st_blocks * 512`) count as freed only when `st_nlink` is 1, so a file with a link outside the target frees nothing. A link that the same pass removed earlier has already lowered the count, so the last link still counts as freed. A failed or partial removal credits only the files it removed.
- `reclaim(group, scan, remaining, dry_run)` returns the estimate on a dry run and the confirmed account on a real run. Both callers, `shrink()` (orphans and the budget pass) and `shrink_floor()`, use it and the same two types. A dry run deletes nothing and records nothing.
- `choose()` is gone. `shrink()` and `shrink_floor()` take the next candidate in removal order and subtract the confirmed bytes, until the account covers the shortfall. When no candidate covers it, the exhaustion alert still goes out.
- `remove_entry()` opens the parent with `O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW`. The recursive delete walks with directory fds and checks each directory's identity with `os.path.samestat` before it opens it and again before `rmdir`. A path replaced by a symlink during the pass is not followed and not credited.

**Files:**
- `scripts/lint/sweep.py` — the two types, `reclaim`, `remove_entry`, `remove_entry_at`, and the loops in `shrink` and `shrink_floor`.
- `scripts/lint/test_sweep.py` — tests for an outside link added after the scan, an earlier unlink in the same pass, a failed and a partial removal, the dry run, a directory swapped for a symlink, and the exhaustion alert when an outside link leaves the floor short.

**Binds later work:** Phase 4 extends this sweep; its deletions go through `reclaim` and credit only `ConfirmedDeletion` bytes. A new caller of the sweep uses the same two types and does not count from the scan on a real run.

### Phase 10 — Memory admission names the reservation a waiting step waits on  · status: done

#### As-built

- `memory_admit.py` has `current_blocker(waiter_path)`. It reads the admission ledger under a shared lock. It does not create the lock, prune stale records or change state files. It uses the same queue view and `decide` rule as `check`; there is no second admission rule.
- The lookup names a reservation only when removing it alone admits the waiter and no other single reservation does. It removes that reservation's full build charge and growth promise, then applies the admission rule. It never assigns a pressure hold to a reservation.
- The verb `memory_admit.py blocker --waiter <waiter file>` prints one JSON line and exits 0: `{"session_id":…,"session_name":…,"pool":"memory"}` when the session is known; `{"unit":…}` when only the cgroup sidecar names a systemd scope or service; `{}` for a ready step, a pressure hold, queue priority, several possible blockers or unknown ownership. A gone waiter file gives exit 2. A stale waiter still on disk gives `{}` and exit 0.
- `CheckResult.blocker` carries the same typed result from the snapshot that admission uses. With `BUILDLOG_MEM_BLOCKER=1`, `check` appends one JSON blocker field to its pipe-separated output: field 16, or field 19 with `BUILDLOG_MEM_DETAIL=1`. JSON escapes a pipe in a name as `\u007c`. Without the opt-in, the 15-field and 18-field forms do not change.

**Files:**
- `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py` — `current_blocker`, the `blocker` verb and the `check` blocker field.
- `scripts/lint/test_memory_admit.py` — tests for each result shape, the exit codes, the `check` field, and that the verb writes nothing.
- `docs/as-built/build-memory-admission.md` — the "Name the reservation that blocks a waiter" section.

**Binds later work:** A change to the admission charge or holds flows into the blocker lookup, because the lookup reuses `decide`; the lookup must follow each new charge and hold. The verify memory wait reads the blocker as `check` field 16 (19 with detail) under `BUILDLOG_MEM_BLOCKER=1`, so it sees a holder change on the poll it already makes, with no separate Python start.

**Gotchas:** Releasing a measured reservation frees only its resident bytes. Its swap bytes stay part of the build charge but do not count as freed RAM.

### Phase 11 — Memory admission promises what each repository's steps really use  · status: todo
**Depends on:** Phase 10 and Phase 12 (same file, `memory_admit.py`); verify-unit's Phase 4 (branch `natedev-verify-memory`). Start after that merge reaches `origin/builds`, and merge `origin/builds` first.

**Approved:** showrunner 2026-10-29 (ETA 22:00 EDT, after Phase 12), from the widget wait study (07:09–11:43 EDT): a measured floor per repository for filtered test runs, and the promises that are 3x or more too high.

#### Work Order

**Goal:** each step's memory promise is close to what that repository's steps use: not so low that a filtered run starts small and then compiles, and not so high that a small repository holds back other builds.

**Measured 2026-10-29 (natedev, 14 days, anon peaks):**
- cargo-liner clippy: keyed rows (repository URL) p90 1.94 GiB over 56 runs; old rows with no key (folder name `cargo-liner`) p90 3.04 GiB over 2061 runs. `expected_peak` mixes both, so the promise is about 3.0 GiB.
- bevy_brp nextest: 5 keyed runs, p90 1.78 GiB. With fewer than 5 own runs, `expected_peak` uses the all-repository pool, p90 10.83 GiB (mostly hana). That gave the 10.9 GiB promise.
- `FILTERED_FLOOR` is one value (1 GiB) for all repositories.

**Spec:**

1. Replay first: for every step in the 14-day history, compute the promise that today's `expected_peak` gives from the history before that step, and compare it to the step's measured anon peak. Report, per repository and step, the count of promises under half the measured peak and over 3x the measured peak. Fresh runs and compile runs (Spec 4's rule) are separate rows. Save the table in the as-built doc. The replay runs again on the result: neither count rises for any repository, and each count falls in total.
2. `expected_peak` (`scripts/lint/memory_admit.py`): when a repository has 5 or more keyed rows, use only keyed rows; old unkeyed rows count only when keyed rows are fewer than 5.
3. A repository with 1 to 4 own runs does not take the all-repository pool p90. Use the largest of its own runs, or the pool when that is lower. A repository with no own runs keeps today's rule.
4. A promise does not mix compile runs and no-compile runs (showrunner 2026-10-29 17:11 EDT, from the user's rule). Spec 4 applies to every step. A history row is a compile run when its index step (anon rows: joined by `call_id` and step name to `steps.call_id` and `steps.step`; index rows: their own column) has `crates_compiled > 0`. A row with no match counts as neither. The step being admitted is a compile run unless verify Phase 4's `is_fresh_test` proves it fresh. A compile run's promise comes only from earlier compile runs; for a filtered run the order is the same as `filtered_peak` today: the exact filter set, then the package's filtered runs, then the check/build peaks. The 1 GiB floor stays only for fresh runs and for a repository with no compile history; do not raise the fresh floor. Fresh runs keep verify Phase 4's `fresh_test_peak` unchanged. `expected_peak()` returns `min(filtered, full)` today, so a compile-run promise above the full-run estimate would not hold: the compile-run promise wins over that minimum, and a test covers a promise above the full estimate; the replay includes that case (Phase 3 architect review, F11). Comment each new constant with the measurement that set it, as the current constants are.
5. Tests in `scripts/lint/test_memory_admit.py`: keyed rows win over unkeyed rows; 1–4 own runs do not take the pool; a compile run's promise uses only compile runs; an anon row with no `call_id` and step match counts as neither; a fresh run keeps the `fresh_test_peak` promise; each test fakes both memory readings.
6. Docs: `docs/as-built/build-memory-admission.md` gets the replay table before and after, and the new rules. The replay script lives in the session folder and is not committed.

**Constraints from prior phases:** Phase 11 changes estimates (`need`) only. It keeps the running charge as Phase 12 built it: current memory, the ramp and unknown-peak promises, the observed peak with its `.wave` decay after 1500 s, the missing-`.wave` fallback to the `.max` mtime, the recovery start spacing, and the estimate-expiry checks after the lock.

**Files:**
- `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py` — items 2–4.
- `scripts/lint/test_memory_admit.py` — item 5.
- `docs/as-built/build-memory-admission.md` — items 1 and 6.

**Workers:** `1 writer`

**Acceptance gate:**
- The memory admission tests pass; `basedpyright` over both Python files reports `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes`; the merge gate is green.
- The replay after the change: neither count rises for any repository, and each count falls in total. The before and after table goes in the checkpoint notice.
- Change-Review line: memory promises match each repository's real use | on natedev run `cargo clippy` in `~/rust/cargo-liner` and read its reservation in `~/.local/state/buildlog/admission` | its `need` is near the compile-only keyed p90 that the replay measures (the phase report gives the figure), not 3.0 GiB.

### Phase 12 — Memory admission counts host swap, sccache compiles and each step's peak  · status: done

#### As-built

- `build_charge` charges a running step the largest of its ramp promise (inside `RAMP_SECONDS`, 120 s), its current memory (`tree_memory`), its observed peak, and its unknown-peak promise. `reservation_memory` reads the peak from `<reservation>.max`; an unreadable `.max` charges the step its `need`. In the blocker lookup a release frees only the step's current resident bytes.
- The peak decays: the `invoke.sh` sampler (`buildlog_sample_anon`) publishes `.max` first, then `<reservation>.wave` = `"<committed peak> <epoch seconds>"` on each new peak and at most once per 60 s while samples stay at or above half the peak. `reservation_memory` drops the peak when the `.wave` peak equals `.max` and its time is `PEAK_DECAY_SECONDS` (1500 s) or more old. With no `.wave` file (a sampler from before the decay), the `.max` mtime is the last near-peak time under the same rule. An empty, malformed, negative, time-only, mismatched or unreadable `.wave` keeps the peak. Release and stale-reservation cleanup remove `.wave` with `.max`.
- The anon of `builds.slice/sccache.service` is added to the build charge once. It is not a reservation and never a blocker; a missing or unreadable file adds nothing.
- `read_meminfo` returns `HostMemory` with `SwapTotal`/`SwapFree`; `read_pressure(host)` holds when `full avg10` > 5, or when swap use is over 85% and `some avg10` is over 25%. The hold text names the reading that caused it. After a pressure hold ends, admission starts at most one step every 30 s; a spacing hold gives `blocker` `{}`.
- `working_set.py` prints each owner by its short unit name (`[resources]`, `[verify]`); `working_set_owners.json` keeps unit ids and holds 69 rules over 12 units, with no retired unit.

**Files:**
- `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py` — the peak, decay and sccache charge, swap and "some" holds, start spacing.
- `scripts/lint/invoke.sh` — `buildlog_sample_anon` writes `.max` and `.wave` atomically (owner verify-unit).
- `scripts/lint/test_memory_admit.py`, `scripts/lint/memory_test_support.py`, `scripts/lint/test_invoke_scope.py`, `scripts/build_queue/test_build_queue.py` — faked readings for every new path.
- `scripts/build_targets/working_set.py`, `scripts/build_targets/test_working_set.py`, `scripts/build_targets/working_set_owners.json` — short owner names and the regenerated snapshot.
- `docs/as-built/build-memory-admission.md` — the charge, decay, holds and spacing.

**Binds later work:** a change to estimates (`need`) leaves the running charge unchanged: current memory, ramp and unknown-peak promises, observed peak with its `.wave` decay and `.max` mtime fallback, and recovery spacing. Any path that deletes a reservation removes `.max` and `.wave` with it.

**Gotchas:** a step keeps the sampler it started with for its whole run, so a change to the sidecar format needs a fallback for steps already running. `PEAK_DECAY_SECONDS` comes from the hana nextest wave gaps (longest 954 s between runs of samples at or above half the peak). Admission tests use a fixed fake clock (2026-10-06), so every `.max` they write sets its mtime with `os.utime`.

**Ruled out:** `RAMP_SECONDS = 600` (kept at 120 s while herdr fixed the swapped herdr server); a time-only `.wave` record (a failed `.wave` write after a new peak would let the old time decay the new peak).

### Phase 13 — A session can launch an app that is already built without waiting at the BRP launch gate  · status: dropped
**Dropped:** showrunner 2026-10-29. There is no bevy_brp prebuilt option and no hook bypass, so every launch keeps waiting, as Phase 6 ruled. The user doubted its value. report-unit first restores the brp-launch rows in the build log (none since 2026-10-15); after that, launch waits get measured, and a new phase starts only if they show a cost.

### Phase 14 — Memory admission, the sweeps and the merge gate finish when they run again after a stop  · status: todo
**Depends on:** Phase 12 (same file, `memory_admit.py`). Runs after Phase 4. Merge `origin/builds` first.

**Approved:** showrunner 2026-10-29 (ETA 02:30 EDT 2026-10-30), from the rerun sweep on `~/.claude` main (`docs/plans/sdlc-rerun-sweep.md`, sdlc tip `097b1a0d`, checked 19:59 EDT): the 2 rows under builds-resources-unit and the 5 rows under resources-unit.

#### Work Order

**Goal:** each command below finishes when it runs again after a stop or a failure at the named line, and a stop never loses a charge or a record that a rerun needs.

**Rows (sweep line numbers are at sdlc `097b1a0d`; find each by its function):**
1. `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` `promote` (sweep :1000, the "main HEAD differs from origin/main" refusal): promotion stops after its local fast-forward of main and before the push, or the push fails. A rerun refuses because main differs from origin/main. Fix: the gate records the exact commit it promotes, with its tested merge, before the local fast-forward. A rerun pushes local main only when local main is that recorded commit and origin/main is its ancestor. Tree equality is not proof. Any other difference still refuses.
2. `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` checkpoint push (sweep :1124) and `check_local_doc_commits` (sweep :1089): the checkpoint push fails after the merge and the tests pass, or stops just before the push. A rerun rejects its own local merge commit. Fix: the gate records each checkpoint merge it makes (checkpoint commit, merge commit, base) before it pushes; the pass ledger certifies tests, not this step, so it is a separate record. `check_local_doc_commits` accepts a local commit only when it is that recorded merge for that checkpoint, and the rerun pushes it. A local commit that is not the gate's own still refuses.
3. `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py` `live_reservations`, `step_memory`, `check` cleanup and `queue_rows` (sweep :811, Q2): a reservation is live only while its owning shell's pid and start time match. If the shell dies while a child in its own process group keeps running, `step_memory` returns `GoneMemory`, `check` deletes the reservation with `.max` and `.wave`, and `queue_rows` hides it, so the child's memory is no longer charged. Fix, across all four paths with one liveness rule: a scoped step's reservation stays live while its step cgroup (the scope `invoke.sh` starts) holds a process; it is charged that cgroup's memory, keeps `.max` and `.wave` until the step ends, and stays visible to the queue and the blocker lookup. Read the cgroup with the same faked-reading support as the other readings. An unscoped step has no cgroup and keeps today's pid rule. When neither the pid nor the cgroup is live, cleanup is as today. Tests cover admission, queue visibility and blocker agreement for an orphaned child.
4. `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py` `set_width` (sweep :1427, Q3): a stop during `path.write_text` leaves incomplete JSON. Its caller starts the step anyway, and the next check deletes the unreadable reservation, so the live step has no charge. Fix: write the row to a temporary file in the same folder and rename it over the reservation, as `.max` is written.
5. `scripts/lint/sweep.py` removal-log retention (sweep :2142, the `seek(0)` / `truncate()` / `writelines` block): a stop after the truncate loses every kept row. Fix: write the kept rows to a temporary file and rename it over the log. The log is also the lock today, and a writer that opened the old inode would append to the replaced file, so append, retention and readers first take one separate stable lock file and open the log only after they hold it. A test runs an append beside a retention and checks that no record is lost.
6. `scripts/lint/tmp_sweep.py` plan write (sweep :1106, `plan.open("x")`): a stop after the exclusive create and before the JSON is complete leaves a plan that `--plan` refuses and `--apply` cannot read. Fix: write the plan to a temporary file and link it into place without replacing an existing plan (keep "an existing plan is never replaced"). A rerun of `--plan` over an incomplete leftover from a stopped run names the file and how to clear it; it does not apply it.
7. `scripts/lint/folder_audit.py` `remove` (sweep :256): a stop after `tmp_sweep.delete_tree` and before `git worktree prune` leaves a stale worktree entry, and a rerun no longer finds the folder or its source. Fix: record the worktree sources before the delete in a small record next to the removal log, prune them, then remove the record; a rerun prunes every source still in a record.

**Spec:**
- Each fix has a test that stops the command at the named line (a fault injected at that point, never a sleep), then runs it again and checks that it finishes with the right state. Tests never read the live cgroup tree, `/proc/meminfo` or `/proc/pressure/memory`.
- Keep every refusal that protects against a wrong state; a rerun repairs only its own stopped work.
- Docs: each as-built doc in Files gets one sentence per row on the rerun rule.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/merge_gate.py`, `scripts/production/test_merge_gate.py`, `scripts/production/test_merge_gate_promotion.py`, `scripts/production/test_merge_gate_ledger.py` (only if ledger coverage is needed), `docs/as-built/merge-gate-and-test-speed.md` — rows 1–2.
- `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py`, `scripts/lint/test_memory_admit.py` (and `scripts/lint/memory_test_support.py` only for the cgroup fake) — rows 3–4.
- `scripts/lint/sweep.py`, `scripts/lint/tmp_sweep.py`, `scripts/lint/folder_audit.py`, `scripts/lint/test_sweep.py`, `scripts/lint/test_tmp_sweep.py`, `scripts/lint/test_folder_audit.py` — rows 5–7.
- `docs/as-built/build-memory-admission.md` (rows 3, 4 and 6) and `docs/as-built/build-targets.md` (rows 5 and 7).

**Workers:** `2 writers`
- `impl` — rows 3–7: the `scripts/lint/` modules and tests above, `build-memory-admission.md` and `build-targets.md`.
- `ws-impl` — rows 1–2: `merge_gate.py`, its three test modules above and `merge-gate-and-test-speed.md`.

**Acceptance gate:**
- Every changed test module passes; `basedpyright` over every changed Python file reports `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes`; the merge gate is green.
- For each row, the notice names the test that stops at its line and reruns.
- Change-Review line: a stopped sweep plan finishes on a rerun | in a terminal on natedev, run `~/.claude/scripts/lib/py ~/.claude/scripts/lint/tmp_sweep.py --plan <file>` twice, stopping the first with Ctrl-C | the second run names the leftover and how to clear it, and a clean rerun writes the plan.
