# sdlc-devtools-tests

> **Status: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN — phased, delegate-ready.** Make the `~/.claude` repo tests run in every gate, faster, and with less CPU. Phase 1 fixes the gate's test list. Phases 4-6 come from the measured inventory of full gate 3 (2026-10-30).

> **Production: sdlc** — unit `devtools-unit`; production doc `docs/plans/sdlc-production.md`

## Source

The user, through the sdlc showrunner, 2026-10-30: "it can also be where we look at making repo tests go faster and take less cpu". Phase 1: herdr through natedev and the showrunner, 2026-10-30. natedev agreed the `merge_gate.py` edit ("take it"; no open natedev branch touches it).

Known input for the inventory: `scripts/agents/test_codex_mesh.py` was killed at the 1800 s module limit under load (gate_merge77.log). It takes about 1251 s unloaded and 741 s in a later gate, and it grows with each mesh test. Check first if herdr's plan retires the mesh soon.

## Delegation Context

- **Project:** `~/.claude` — Claude Code commands, skills, hooks and scripts that run the user's productions.
- **Project started:** 2026-10-30T11:40:41.136+00:00
- **Stack:** Python 3.13, standard library only; Markdown.
- **Key files:**
  - `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — the merge gate: finds test modules, runs them under a memory cap, keeps the passed-tree ledger (`PassedTreeLedger`)
  - `scripts/production/merge_gate_test_support.py`, `scripts/production/test_merge_gate*.py` — its fixture and tests
  - `docs/as-built/merge-gate-and-test-speed.md` — the gate's as-built
- **Test:** `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/production -p 'test_merge_gate*.py'`, from the worktree root. Gate: `env HERDR_BIN=/nonexistent/herdr python3 scripts/production/merge_gate.py --repo . --tests-only --full`, from the worktree root.
- **Lint:** `basedpyright <changed Python files>` passes when its output has the `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes` line; the exit status says nothing.
- **Invariants:**
  - Tests use fixtures; they never read live state (`~/.claude` main, `/tmp/claude`, `~/.cargo/bin`).
  - Python is typed throughout, with no `Any` and no file-level type ignores (user, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).
  - All text uses Simplified Technical English (user, 2026-10-18).
  - One place for each thing: no second list of suites anywhere (user, 2026-10-30).

## Phases

### Phase 1 — The merge gate finds every test module itself  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` has no suite list. `discover_test_modules` finds every `scripts/**/test_*.py` outside `__pycache__`, sorted by path. A module's suite is its first folder under `scripts/`, so a module in a nested `tests/` folder runs under its top folder's suite. Each module runs as `unittest discover -s <its folder> -p <its file>`, with the repo as cwd.
- A test file directly in `scripts/` makes the gate refuse before any job starts, and the message names the path. An empty test list is refused too. The passed-tree ledger `suites` field holds the sorted found suite names.
- `GateJobKind` (`TEST_MODULE`, `TYPE_CHECK`) selects job behavior, so a folder named `types` runs its tests. `GateJobRequest` keeps each job's real path, so holds and retries run that path.
- Each job reserves its last recorded peak × `MEMORY_PEAK_MARGIN` (1.2). One margin covers modules and the types job. A module with no record reserves the largest recorded module peak × 1.2, or `UNRECORDED_MODULE_RESERVATION_MIB` (640) when no module has a record. A types job with no record reserves `TYPES_MEMORY_MIB` (3072).
- A job starts only when the latest aggregate sample, the remaining reservations of the running jobs and its own reservation sum to the cap or less. With nothing running, one job always starts.
- `module_peak_mib.json` in the gate state dir holds each module's last sampled peak under its `<suite>/<path within the suite>` key (`test_module_name`), beside `types_peak_mib.json`. The gate writes it at run end. A job killed for a limit records nothing.
- `DEFAULT_MEMORY_CAP_MIB` is 6144. It holds the types job's reservation (full-tree basedpyright peak 4065 MiB × 1.2 = 4878 MiB) with modules beside it. A job over the cap is killed, and a sampled peak over the cap makes the run red.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — discovery, job kinds, recorded-peak admission, peak records, the cap.
- `scripts/production/merge_gate_test_support.py` — the fixture; the folder names it writes are fixture data only.
- `scripts/production/test_merge_gate*.py` — tests for discovery, nested modules, the `types` folder, the root-file refusal, the ledger key and admission.
- `scripts/berth/tests/check_installed_hooks.py` — checks the installed front end, not the checkout, so it is not a gate test. `scripts/berth/install/README.md` tells how to run it after an install: `cd ~/.claude/scripts && python3 -m unittest berth.tests.check_installed_hooks`.
- `docs/as-built/merge-gate-and-test-speed.md` — discovery and recorded-peak admission. `long-lived-workers.md`, `style-showrunner.md`, `bevy-upgrade.md` and `showrunner-automation.md` in `docs/as-built/` describe discovery, not a list.

**Binds later work:** a test module in any `scripts/<folder>/` runs in every gate with no list edit. The copy check in "Every test uses the one hang guard" uses this.

**Gotchas:**
- A new test folder changes the ledger `suites` key, so the next gate runs in full one time.
- `shot_report/test_transcripts.py` fails only when TMPDIR is inside a Claude scratchpad path. Under the gate's `/dev/shm` TMPDIR it passes.

**Ruled out:** a `"types"` suite name to select the type check; a retry path built again from suite and module names.

### Phase 2 — Every test uses the one hang guard  · status: done
**Depends on:** Phase 1; models' dc80ee4c (`scripts/lib/test_hang_guard.py`, `scripts/agents` on it), on origin/sdlc and merged here at d721ac43

#### As-built

- Every test module and test support module imports its hang limit from `scripts/lib/test_hang_guard.py` (`TEST_HANG_GUARD_SECS = 600`, `LauncherHangGuard`). No local copy or alias stays, `HANG_GUARD_S` included. The change spans every `scripts/` folder except `scripts/agents/`, which already used the guard.
- `scripts/lib/test_one_hang_guard.py` parses every `scripts/**/*.py`. It refuses an assignment to `TEST_HANG_GUARD_SECS` outside the guard module, a module-level alias, and an import of either name from any other module. Each refusal names `path:line`. A second test runs the check on a temporary tree with one copy and expects the refusal.
- A literal timeout under 120 s on a wait for an expected event now uses the guard, because short real-time limits fail under load. A wait that proves an event does not occur in a window stays. A sleep that is the behavior under test stays. A timeout given to product code as its own setting stays.
- The fixture script text in `scripts/production/merge_gate_test_support.py` keeps its `__TEST_HANG_GUARD_SECS__` placeholder, because the fixture repo has no `scripts.lib`. The value put in comes from the imported name. Text in a string is not code, so the check passes it.

**Files:**
- `scripts/lib/test_one_hang_guard.py` — the copy check and its temporary-tree test
- `scripts/**/test_*.py`, `scripts/**/*_test_support.py` — take the guard from the one place
- `docs/as-built/merge-gate-and-test-speed.md` — names the one 600-second guard

**Binds later work:** Every test hang limit comes from `scripts/lib/test_hang_guard.py` and the check refuses a copy. The merge gate finds the check by itself. `scripts/production/test_merge_gate_suites_resources.py` keeps its real CPU workloads and their assertions, so `os.wait4` can tell the workloads apart.

**Gotchas:**
- Assertions on elapsed wall time keep their literal limits. No shared test clock exists.
- Code from a merge can add a copy. The check then goes red in the gate, and the merge must move the copy to the guard.
- A commit message with `Assertion-Change` lines must come from a file (`git commit -F`), because the commit hook reads `-m` text badly.

**Ruled out:** A support module that passes the guard name on: each file imports it directly. `LifecycleTestClock` as the shared clock: it lives only in `scripts/agents/test_codex_mesh.py` and retires with the mesh.

### Phase 2b — A user's bump merges first and gates the pushed tip  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- `merge_checkpoint.py --bump` is for a user's bump only, and its help text says so. It applies only to a code checkpoint. `user_bump` refuses it with `--shrink`, `--as-built` or `--from-child` before any merge.
- With `--bump`, `run` keeps scope, conflicts, other units, merge, push, records and promotion in their order, but runs no tests before the push. The `test` step reports that the gate runs on the pushed tip in the background, and the merge log line says `gate after push`. A rerun after a stop between merge and push also runs no tests. Without `--bump`, nothing changes: a red test stops the merge.
- After the push and before `promote`, `start_gate` writes a `BumpGateRecord` to `checkpoint_step_record(checkout, merge_head, "bump-gate")`, with `bump-gate.log` beside it. It starts `scripts/production/bump_gate.py --record <path>` in its own session, with stdin closed and output in the log, and does not wait. Promotion runs as for any merge. A start failure is a red result and does not stop promotion.
- The record holds the tip, the gate plan (paths, Merge tests, flakes, flaky tests), the production and unit names, the runner `pid` and `proc_start`, `result` (`pending`, `green`, `red`), `detail`, `log` and `delivered_to`. A rerun for the same tip starts no second gate while the runner lives, reports `held` when liveness is unknown, starts the gate again when the runner died with no result, and sends a completed result only to recipients not in `delivered_to`.
- `bump_gate.py` claims the record under `record_lock`, and stops with no tests when the result is done or a live other runner holds it. It makes a `git clone --shared` of the production checkout in a temporary folder beside the record, detached at the tip, and runs `run_checkpoint_test_steps` there. Flake notes go to the real checkout's production log. The clone goes at the end; the log stays. Any failure, also before the first step, is red.
- `run_checkpoint_test_steps(production, paths, merge_tests, flakes, flaky_tests, log) -> str` is the one copy of the test steps, pass rule, flake rule and rerun of named failures. `checkpoint_tests` and the bump gate both call it. It appends to the log, and the caller owns merge rollback. A red step names its failing tests when known.
- A red result goes to the unit and the showrunner, a green result to the showrunner only, through `scripts/message/send.py` (`MERGE_CHECKPOINT_SEND` overrides it). The text is `Bump gate <red|green>: <unit>; tip <tip>; <detail>; log <log>`. A failed send is written to the log and retried once. Each sent recipient is saved in `delivered_to`.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/merge_checkpoint.py` — the flag, the path with no tests, `start_gate`, the record and its lock, `run_checkpoint_test_steps`, `complete_gate`, `send_result`, `bump_gate_addresses`.
- `scripts/production/bump_gate.py` — the background gate on the pushed tip.
- `scripts/production/test_merge_checkpoint_bump.py`, `scripts/production/merge_checkpoint_test_support.py` — tests through the real `run` path on a fixture repo with a real origin, and their fixture.
- `commands/showrunner/bump.md` — step 3 runs <MergeCheckpoint/> with `--bump`; step 4 says what the gate does; `bump done` is logged once the tip is green. `commands/showrunner/produce.md` and `docs/as-built/showrunner-automation.md` name the flag.

**Gotchas:**
- `complete_gate` and `send_result` read the record again under `record_lock` and write only when it still names this runner (`same_gate_runner`: tip, pid, process start). An old runner cannot replace a new owner's result or send one.
- Addresses come at send time from `bump_gate_addresses(slug, unit)` (`unit_lookup.marked_unit`, `showrunners.current_address`). The record keeps only slug and unit, so a notice follows a recipient that moved during the run.

**Ruled out:** the gate in the production checkout (a merge may start there), in a copied `.git` pointer (it moves the real branch) or in an export with no git (it fails a shutdown test); a second copy of the test-step, pass or flake code.

### Phase 2c — The assertion guard pairs a moved Rust string continuation  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- `normalized(text: str, rust: bool) -> str` builds the comparison key. Inside a non-raw Rust string (`"…"`, `b"…"`, `c"…"`), `rust_string_key` drops each `\` + newline + the leading whitespace on the next line, which is Rust's own rule. A Rust assertion that moves and changes indent after a `\` continuation in its message pairs with its old copy and is no finding. A changed word after the `\` is still a finding.
- `rust_string_key` reads escape pairs in order, so an escaped `\\` before a newline is no continuation. Raw strings (`r"…"`, `r#"…"#`, `br#"…"#`, `cr#"…"#`) and every Python literal keep their text as written.
- The `rust` flag is `path.endswith(".rs")` of the file. `DiffLine.key`, `parse_assertion`, `comparison_operands`, `numeric_comparison` and `finding_identity` pass it. Every file uses the Rust lexer (`lexical_spans(text, True)`), as before; the flag decides only whether the continuation rule runs.
- `RUST_LITERAL` reads the `c"…"` and `cr#"…"#` prefixes.
- In `~/rust/cargo-liner`, `assertion_guard.py --base e21d5b93^ --head e21d5b93` prints `assertion guard: 73 blocking`, with the same 73 items as before. Change-review row C437 stays as written.

**Files:**
- `scripts/direct/assertion_guard.py` — `rust_string_key`, the `rust` flag on `normalized` and its callers, the `c`/`cr` prefixes in `RUST_LITERAL`.
- `scripts/direct/test_assertion_guard_strings.py` — tests for a moved continuation (`""`, `b`, `c`), a changed word, escaped backslashes, raw strings, and Python continuations and f-strings.
- `scripts/direct/assertion_guard_test_support.py` — `move_rust_assertion_to_test_file`, which moves a test from `render.rs` to `render/tests/mod.rs` with a new indent.

**Gotchas:**
- `numeric_comparison` passes the file's own flag. Python never gets to numeric pairing, because `numeric_constants` is set only for `.rs` files.

**Ruled out:** the Python lexer for `.py` files in the key (it changes the 6b literal-exact pairing outside this rule); the continuation rule for Python literals.

### Phase 3 — Close-route closes a route made before its phase record  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- `scripts/history/routed.py` keys each route `<run id>:<phase instance id>:<finding id>` from its `finding_routed` event. A route made before its run's phase record has an empty phase instance id, so the routed-work list prints its key as `<run id>::<finding id>`.
- `findings.py close-route --from` takes the exact key that the routed-work list prints, and it accepts an empty phase instance id. It refuses a key without exactly three parts, and a key with an empty or blank run id or finding id. The refusal message names both forms: `<run id>:<phase instance id>:<finding id>` and `<run id>::<finding id>`.
- The `finding_route_closed` event keeps its shape. No reader of it changed.

**Files:**
- `scripts/direct/findings.py` — `_close_route` checks the `--from` key.
- `scripts/direct/test_findings.py` — one test closes a route from before a phase record through the real routed-work join (`routed_work`); one test shows that nine malformed keys refuse and record no event.

**Ruled out:** a second `--from` form, or a translation from one form to the other — `--from` is always the exact listed key.

### Phase 4 — The gate records each job's CPU time  · status: done

#### As-built

- `reap_gate_job` in `merge_gate.py` reaps a job leader with `os.wait4`. It stores the exit status and `ru_utime + ru_stime` on the job, and `GateJobResult.cpu_seconds` carries the value.
- `reap_gate_job` blocks SIGTERM and SIGHUP (`ROLLBACK_SIGNALS`) with `signal.pthread_sigmask` across `os.wait4` and the stores. An interrupt arrives only after the status and CPU are stored, so it cannot lose a reaped status or stop the cleanup of later jobs.
- At run end, `save_measures` writes `module_cpu_seconds.json` in the gate state dir, under the `<suite>/<module>` keys of `module_seconds.json`; the type-check job uses `types/basedpyright`. A job killed for a limit records nothing.
- After `Largest module peak:`, the report prints `Most CPU: <s> s <suite/module>, …; total <s> s`: the three keys with the most CPU, largest first. The run total adds every attempt, killed and requeued attempts too.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — `reap_gate_job`, the CPU record, the `Most CPU:` line
- `scripts/production/test_merge_gate_suites_resources.py` — spin and sleep CPU, killed job, report order, interrupt after a reap
- `docs/as-built/merge-gate-and-test-speed.md` — names the record and the report line

**Binds later work:** "The slowest modules lose their real-time waits" ranks modules by wall seconds minus CPU seconds from `module_seconds.json` and `module_cpu_seconds.json`. "The gate runs a large module's test classes as separate jobs" builds on two facts: `reap_gate_job` is the one path that reaps a job and reads its CPU, and one CPU key names one job.

**Gotchas:**
- `systemd-run --scope` execs the test in place, so the leader's rusage holds the test and the children it waited for. A child that `kill_job_group` kills after its leader exits is not counted.
- The signal mask covers the calling thread only. The gate starts no other thread.
- `module_seconds.json` holds the first attempt's wall time, and `module_cpu_seconds.json` holds the last finished attempt's CPU. Compare the two only from one attempt.

### Phase 5 — The gate runs a large module's test classes as separate jobs  · status: done

Dropped 2026-10-30 by its own rule: no module that natedev's condition allows to split would cut the gate's wall time. From `module_history.json` (last five runs) and each module's classes: the slowest module, `direct/test_assign_launcher.py` (413-1204 s), has one class and `setUpModule`; `agents/test_codex_mesh.py` has `setUpModule`; the modules with more than one class and no module setup all ran under 60 s last time (`hana_shot/test_hana_shot.py` 59 s, 12 classes; `agents/test_agents_conf_publish.py` 46 s, 3 classes; `herdr/test_herdr.py` 41 s, 3 classes). The wall-time lever is Phase 6: the waits in `direct/test_assign_launcher.py`.

### Phase 6 — One agents.conf parse per resolve  · status: done

#### As-built

- `_agents_registry_read` in `scripts/agents/agents_config.sh` parses agents.conf once per top-level reader call. It builds one in-shell table of sections and trimmed `key=value` rows (`_agents_table_*` locals) from `agents_registry_text`, which stays the one read point. Every registry reader uses this table. Nested readers and command substitutions reuse it.
- One resolve reads the registry once, not 9 times. `direct/test_assign_launcher.py` takes 300 s, down from 545 s on the same machine.
- `agents_config_trim <value> [<out var>]` trims in the same shell when it gets an output variable. No line gets its own subshell.
- `agents_registry_edit` and `agents_registry_store` mark the table stale. A changed `AGENTS_CONFIG_FILE` or `AGENTS_REGISTRY_BASE` makes the next read parse again. The table does not live across separate `bash -c` calls.
- Every reader gives the same outputs, errors and exit codes as before, the `codex_mesh.py` callers included. The agents.conf format is unchanged.

**Files:**
- `scripts/agents/agents_config.sh` — the one parse, the table and its readers
- `scripts/agents/test_agents_config.sh` — one-read-per-resolve, edit refresh and file-switch tests, and the pinned reader results

**Binds later work:** the codex_mesh queue grace change measures `direct/test_assign_launcher.py` from 300 s.

**Gotchas:**
- A write to agents.conf that does not go through `agents_registry_store` is not seen until the next top-level call. Each call reads one snapshot.
- The merge gate runs only `test_*.py` modules. Run `bash scripts/agents/test_agents_config.sh` by hand from the worktree root.

**Ruled out:** a table refresh on outside writes during one call — every writer uses the store path.

### Phase 6b — The queue grace reaches child processes in tests  · status: todo
**Depends on:** Phase 6; models' compaction repair 2 checkpoint (models sends the hash, ETA 23:00 EDT 2026-10-30)

Source: devtools-unit diagnosis, 2026-10-30; models-unit's go, 2026-10-30. `QUEUE_GRACE_SECS = 3.0` (`scripts/agents/codex_mesh.py:306`, used at about line 2978) makes `follow` wait 3 s after each turn. `MeshCommandFixture` patches it to 0.0 in the test process (`scripts/agents/test_codex_mesh.py:831`), but `direct/test_assign_launcher.py` runs codex_mesh as a child process, so the child still waits: 3 s per dispatch. Goal: codex_mesh reads the grace from one env var at use (default 3.0), and `MeshCommandFixture` sets that env var where it patches the constant now. Build on models' checkpoint, which rewrites much of both files; send models the diff for those two files before the merge. The Work Order is written when the hash arrives.

From Phase 6: the agents.conf parse fix took `direct/test_assign_launcher.py` from 545 s to 300 s (42 tests, natedev, 2026-10-30). 300 s is the before figure for this phase's timing.

### Phase 7 — The assertion guard keeps the branch's own base after a merge of the merge branch  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

Source: the sdlc showrunner, 2026-10-31, from inspectors-unit (tool-based-ui) lint run 20261031T054106. Analysis: `/tmp/claude/delegate/8777d55e-0ac2-4586-94c5-c7c309274d22/phases/14/fix3_summary.txt`, section "Guard 26". Their workaround is `VERIFY_ASSERTION_BASE=<phase HEAD>`.

#### Work Order

**Goal:** after a unit merges its merge branch, `assertion_guard.py` with no `--base` reports only the assertion changes of the branch's own work, the same as before the merge, and it never drops a change in the working diff.

**Spec:**
- Cause (measured, inspectors, HEAD 03fafc1d6c): `default_base` (`scripts/direct/assertion_guard.py` about line 1319) takes the production merge-base or the upstream merge-base, whichever has fewer `base..HEAD` commits. Before the merge the upstream base b45c99b672 won (10 against 26), and `run` (about line 1447) added HEAD's second parent 86276e88d9, so findings were the intersection of two bases. After the merge the upstream count is 73, because the count includes the trunk commits the merge brought in, so the production merge-base 489bcff1a5 won (27). It is also HEAD's second parent, so the dedup left one base and no intersection. Lint then blocked on 24 old branch-against-trunk differences that are not in the working diff and are already absent at the upstream base.
- After a merge of the merge branch, the base choice gives the same comparison as before the merge: the merge's trunk commits do not count against the upstream base. Old committed branch-against-trunk differences that are already absent at the upstream base are no findings.
- A change in the working diff (uncommitted, or staged with `--staged`) is never dropped by the parent intersection. Measured case: inspectors entries 13 and 14 are real working-diff assertion changes. The intersection hid them before the merge, because their old test name (and for 14 the finding kind) differs between the upstream base and the trunk base.
- An explicit `--base` (and `VERIFY_ASSERTION_BASE`) keeps its current meaning. Every existing test in `test_assertion_guard*.py` and `test_verify_assertion_guard.py` keeps its result, among them the completed-merge, ticket-108, upstream-against-production and diverged-base tests.
- One base choice and one intersection: fix them where they are, with no second selector and no per-caller patch.

**Files:**
- `scripts/direct/assertion_guard.py` — the base choice in `default_base` and the parent intersection in `run`
- `scripts/direct/test_assertion_guard_revisions.py` — tests for the merge of the merge branch and for the working-diff changes
- `scripts/direct/assertion_guard_test_support.py` — a shared fixture step for "merge the production branch into the unit branch", when the tests need one

**Workers:** 1 writer + 1 tester
- `impl` — `scripts/direct/assertion_guard.py`
- `test` — `scripts/direct/test_assertion_guard_revisions.py` and `scripts/direct/assertion_guard_test_support.py`, from this Spec alone: (a) a unit branch pushed with an assertion removed that trunk still has, trunk then advanced and merged into the branch, gives no finding with no `--base`; (b) the same shape plus a new working-tree removal reports that removal; (c) a working-tree change to an assertion in a test that the branch renamed against trunk is reported. Each new test fails on the old code.

**State:** none

**Constraints from prior phases:** the `rust` flag of `normalized` and `finding_identity` is `path.endswith(".rs")` (Phase 2c). In `~/rust/cargo-liner`, `assertion_guard.py --base e21d5b93^ --head e21d5b93` prints `assertion guard: 73 blocking` (change-review row C437); an explicit base must still give that.

**Acceptance gate:** `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/direct -p 'test_assertion_guard*.py'` and `-p 'test_verify_assertion_guard.py'` green, with the new tests failing on the old code; `basedpyright` on each slot's files `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes`; live check, read only: in `/home/natepiano/rust/hana_catalyst-inspectors`, `python3 <worktree>/scripts/direct/assertion_guard.py --repo .` gives the same findings as `--base HEAD` on the same tree, and none of the 24 old items; the cargo-liner C437 line still prints 73.

**Repair round 4 rule (after the merge of sdlc aed34e81, which brought natedev-verify's `commit_bases` and owner-free `finding_identity`; showrunner ruling 2026-10-31: one rule for base and merge parents, no second path; Astra review `/tmp/claude/astra/20261031T113652Z-318765/review.md`):** `commit_bases` is the one selector. With no `--base`, its starting bases are every distinct one of the upstream merge-base and the production merge-base (the nearest-remote fallback and its ambiguity refusal stay); then it adds merge parents in `base..target` and `MERGE_HEAD` as now, and drops every base another base descends from (`git merge-base --independent`). An explicit `--base` keeps its list and order. `default_base` goes. The comparison stays the per-base intersection by owner-free identity. There is no second comparison path: round 4's HEAD-to-tree supplement counted one removal twice after a production rename merge (closure pass 4), and Astra review `/tmp/claude/astra/20261031T121403Z-1704209/review.md` found each repair of its reconciliation opens a new owner or grouping edge, so repair round 5 removes it. `tree_watch.py` keys the lint cache on the bases `commit_bases` returns. Second live check (showrunner): inspectors HEAD 03fafc1d6c (merge of 489bcff1a5 into 6236e6f419) with no `--base`: before and after counts go in the notice.

### Phase 7b — The assertion guard compares against the combined history of its bases  · status: todo
**Depends on:** Phase 7

Source: Phase 7 repair round 4 (landing rule; showrunner ruling 2026-10-31). Astra review `/tmp/claude/astra/20261031T113652Z-318765/review.md` items 1-3. Phase 7's per-base intersection hides a branch-made removal of an assertion whose text differs per base. Distinguishing test (clean tree, no conflicts, one test name): fork with `self.assertEqual(value, 1)`; pushed U changes it to `2`; P changes another file; merge U and P and replace the assertion with `pass`; add an unrelated commit. With no `--base` and `--head HEAD`, the guard must give exactly one blocking removal of `self.assertEqual(value, 2)`. The same hole covers a working-tree or index removal of an assertion whose text the merge changed (Phase 7 round 4 tried a HEAD-to-tree supplement; it double-counted after a rename merge, and Astra review `/tmp/claude/astra/20261031T121403Z-1704209/review.md` lists the owner, replacement and grouping edges a fix must handle): the guard must give exactly one blocking removal with HEAD's spelling, and its count on the tree or index must never exceed the `--base HEAD` count for local changes. Design inputs: Phase 7 round 3's merge-tree fold (saved in the Phase 7 run folder as `round3_wip/assertion_guard.py`), and that its whole-path conflict fallback reports imported removals. natedev-verify's explicit multi-`--base` tests require intersection semantics: the Work Order must name each one it changes. The Work Order is written when the phase starts.
