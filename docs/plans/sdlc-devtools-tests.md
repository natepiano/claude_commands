# sdlc-devtools-tests

> **Status: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN — phased, delegate-ready.** Make the `~/.claude` repo tests run in every gate, faster, and with less CPU. Phase 1 fixes the gate's test list. The measured inventory and its phases come after Phase 1.

> **Production: sdlc** — unit `devtools-unit`; production doc `docs/plans/sdlc-production.md`

## Source

The user, through the sdlc showrunner, 2026-10-30: "it can also be where we look at making repo tests go faster and take less cpu". Phase 1: herdr through natedev and the showrunner, 2026-10-30. natedev agreed the `merge_gate.py` edit ("take it"; no open natedev branch touches it).

Known input for the inventory: `scripts/agents/test_codex_mesh.py` was killed at the 1800 s module limit under load (gate_merge77.log). It takes about 1251 s unloaded and 741 s in a later gate, and it grows with each mesh test. Check first if herdr's plan retires the mesh soon.

## Delegation Context

- **Project:** `~/.claude` — Claude Code commands, skills, hooks and scripts that run the user's productions.
- **Project started:** 2026-10-30T11:40:41.136+00:00
- **Stack:** Python 3.13, standard library only; Markdown.
- **Key files:**
  - `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — the merge gate: finds test modules, runs them under a memory cap, keeps the passed-tree ledger (`PassedTreeLedger`)
  - `scripts/production/merge_gate_test_support.py`, `scripts/production/test_merge_gate*.py` — its fixture and tests
  - `docs/as-built/merge-gate-and-test-speed.md` — the gate's as-built
- **Test:** `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/production -p 'test_merge_gate*.py'`, from the worktree root. Gate: `env HERDR_BIN=/nonexistent/herdr python3 scripts/production/merge_gate.py --repo . --tests-only --full`, from the worktree root.
- **Lint:** `basedpyright <changed Python files>` passes when its output has the `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes` line; the exit status says nothing.
- **Invariants:**
  - Tests use fixtures; they never read live state (`~/.claude` main, `/tmp/claude`, `~/.cargo/bin`).
  - Python is typed throughout, with no `Any` and no file-level type ignores (user, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).
  - All text uses Simplified Technical English (user, 2026-10-18).
  - One place for each thing: no second list of suites anywhere (user, 2026-10-30).

## Phases

### Phase 1 — The merge gate finds every test module itself  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` has no suite list. `discover_test_modules` finds every `scripts/**/test_*.py` outside `__pycache__`, sorted by path. A module's suite is its first folder under `scripts/`, so a module in a nested `tests/` folder runs under its top folder's suite. Each module runs as `unittest discover -s <its folder> -p <its file>`, with the repo as cwd.
- A test file directly in `scripts/` makes the gate refuse before any job starts, and the message names the path. An empty test list is refused too. The passed-tree ledger `suites` field holds the sorted found suite names.
- `GateJobKind` (`TEST_MODULE`, `TYPE_CHECK`) selects job behavior, so a folder named `types` runs its tests. `GateJobRequest` keeps each job's real path, so holds and retries run that path.
- Each job reserves its last recorded peak × `MEMORY_PEAK_MARGIN` (1.2). One margin covers modules and the types job. A module with no record reserves the largest recorded module peak × 1.2, or `UNRECORDED_MODULE_RESERVATION_MIB` (640) when no module has a record. A types job with no record reserves `TYPES_MEMORY_MIB` (3072).
- A job starts only when the latest aggregate sample, the remaining reservations of the running jobs and its own reservation sum to the cap or less. With nothing running, one job always starts.
- `module_peak_mib.json` in the gate state dir holds each module's last sampled peak under its `<suite>/<path within the suite>` key (`test_module_name`), beside `types_peak_mib.json`. The gate writes it at run end. A job killed for a limit records nothing.
- `DEFAULT_MEMORY_CAP_MIB` is 6144. It holds the types job's reservation (full-tree basedpyright peak 4065 MiB × 1.2 = 4878 MiB) with modules beside it. A job over the cap is killed, and a sampled peak over the cap makes the run red.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — discovery, job kinds, recorded-peak admission, peak records, the cap.
- `scripts/production/merge_gate_test_support.py` — the fixture; the folder names it writes are fixture data only.
- `scripts/production/test_merge_gate*.py` — tests for discovery, nested modules, the `types` folder, the root-file refusal, the ledger key and admission.
- `scripts/berth/tests/check_installed_hooks.py` — checks the installed front end, not the checkout, so it is not a gate test. `scripts/berth/install/README.md` tells how to run it after an install: `cd ~/.claude/scripts && python3 -m unittest berth.tests.check_installed_hooks`.
- `docs/as-built/merge-gate-and-test-speed.md` — discovery and recorded-peak admission. `long-lived-workers.md`, `style-showrunner.md`, `bevy-upgrade.md` and `showrunner-automation.md` in `docs/as-built/` describe discovery, not a list.

**Binds later work:** a test module in any `scripts/<folder>/` runs in every gate with no list edit. The copy check in "Every test uses the one hang guard" uses this.

**Gotchas:**
- A new test folder changes the ledger `suites` key, so the next gate runs in full one time.
- `shot_report/test_transcripts.py` fails only when TMPDIR is inside a Claude scratchpad path. Under the gate's `/dev/shm` TMPDIR it passes.

**Ruled out:** a `"types"` suite name to select the type check; a retry path built again from suite and module names.

### Phase 2 — Every test uses the one hang guard  · status: todo
**Depends on:** Phase 1; models' checkpoint that moves the hang guard to `scripts/lib` and moves `scripts/agents` onto it (ETA 10:45 EDT, 2026-10-30)

Source: the sdlc showrunner, 2026-10-30. 106 test files under `scripts/` each define their own `TEST_HANG_GUARD_SECS` (105 at 300 s, `recorder_fixture.py` at 600 s), and many set their own short real-time limits that fail under load (the cause of the `agents/test_codex_mesh.py` red in Phase 1's gate). After models' checkpoint, one mechanical checkpoint from devtools: every other test imports the one guard; each short real-time limit goes onto the guard, or onto the shared `LifecycleTestClock` where time is the behavior under test; and a check refuses a new local copy. Owners are many; tell natedev which natedev-owned folders it touches. The merge gate finds every `scripts/**/test_*.py` itself (Phase 1), so the copy check runs in every gate from any folder with no list edit; a test file directly in `scripts/` is refused. The Work Order is written when models sends the import form.

### Phase 3 — Close-route closes a route made before its phase record  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- `scripts/history/routed.py` keys each route `<run id>:<phase instance id>:<finding id>` from its `finding_routed` event. A route made before its run's phase record has an empty phase instance id, so the routed-work list prints its key as `<run id>::<finding id>`.
- `findings.py close-route --from` takes the exact key that the routed-work list prints, and it accepts an empty phase instance id. It refuses a key without exactly three parts, and a key with an empty or blank run id or finding id. The refusal message names both forms: `<run id>:<phase instance id>:<finding id>` and `<run id>::<finding id>`.
- The `finding_route_closed` event keeps its shape. No reader of it changed.

**Files:**
- `scripts/direct/findings.py` — `_close_route` checks the `--from` key.
- `scripts/direct/test_findings.py` — one test closes a route from before a phase record through the real routed-work join (`routed_work`); one test shows that nine malformed keys refuse and record no event.

**Ruled out:** a second `--from` form, or a translation from one form to the other — `--from` is always the exact listed key.
