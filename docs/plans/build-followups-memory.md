# Build follow-ups: builds that fit in memory — plan

> **Status: planned.** Every build on natedev, CI's and the sessions', fits in memory because of how it's admitted, so earlyoom is a rare last resort and not a routine event. Target: a normal working day has no earlyoom kill.
> **Production: build-followups** — unit `stalls-unit`; production doc `docs/plans/build-followups-production.md`

## Context

- **Source:** the user, 2026-10-04 11:46 PDT: "we need a better way for everything to live together rather than having the failsafe constantly engaging". It was prompted by the tool-based-ui showrunner's earlyoom report (11:43 PDT), whose items are inputs here. On 2026-10-04 the user held its item 1 (CI's kill order) for this plan's design.
- **Measured by natedev, 2026-10-04 (earlyoom journal, gh):**
  - 49 earlyoom kills, all on 2026-10-04 (none on Oct 3), all SIGTERM. 45 were session builds and 4 were CI.
  - Episodes (PDT): 01:23 (1), 02:41 (1), 03:39 (1), 07:06 (1), 07:21 (2, CI), 09:21 (2), 09:31 (8), 10:07 (8), 11:12–11:13 (21, the minute after one build hold was released to every session at once; largest 1.9 GB), 11:28–11:30 (2 CI, 2 session).
  - CI runs hit: 37208624435 (one job killed at 07:21; passed on attempt 2), and 37224315720 (both Linux jobs, "Compile and Production Wiring" and "Test Suite", failed 11:28 and 11:30).
  - At 11:29 one session rustc (crate hana, bin, release with tracing) held 15,020 MiB on its own.
- **Why the failsafe fires:** two admission systems that can't see each other.
  - CI: 2 runners, `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8` each, in `hana-ci.slice` (MemoryMax 40G, which counts page cache; MemoryPeak reached 40G). It isn't in steve.
  - Sessions: steve (`/etc/nixos/modules/linux/jobserver.nix`) gives out 31 slots plus one free slot per build. It stops giving slots while MemAvailable is under 12 GiB, but a compiler grows after it's admitted.
  - earlyoom (`/etc/nixos/modules/linux/memory.nix`) SIGTERMs at about 3 GiB available while free swap is at or under 25%. The 8 GB swapfile was full at 11:47 PDT, so the swap condition is always met.
  - No session build has a cap, and app.slice must not get one (memory `connected-but-unreachable-is-memory-livelock`: a cap there stalls the sessions).
- **CI's kill order:** the GitHub runner sets every job process to oom_score_adj 500 (Runner.Sdk), overriding what it inherits; session processes are at 200. So the runner service's OOMScoreAdjust can't reach the jobs, and the setting that does is `PIPELINE_JOB_OOMSCOREADJ` in the runners' `extraEnvironment` (`/etc/nixos/modules/linux/hana-runners.nix`). natedev drafted `PIPELINE_JOB_OOMSCOREADJ = "0"` and set it aside until this design. Changing it restarts both runners at the next rebuild.
- **Your Phase 1 work** (`buildlog sample`, memory stalls) is the measurement to build on.

## Delegation Context

- **Project:** `~/.claude` (commands, skills, scripts; Python 3.13 and shell). Machine changes (`/etc/nixos`) go to natedev as an exact diff: you don't edit `/etc/nixos`.
- **Files:** `scripts/delegate/verify.sh`, `scripts/validate_and_push/`, `commands/build_hold.md`, `scripts/production/dailies_render.py` (`--footer`), and any new shared script (one place, used by every caller). The showrunner settles any clash with the owning units.
- **Test:** `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/buildlog -p 'test_*.py'` plus tests for every new script; `basedpyright` clean on changed Python; `bash -n`/`zsh -n` on changed shell.
- **Invariants:** a test never builds hana or loads the real machine, and never writes `~/.local/state/buildlog`. A Rust build for testing runs in a `git clone --local` under `/tmp`. Times carry their zone.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Where the memory goes, and the design · status: todo

From the build log and the earlyoom journal: peak memory per build kind and per large crate (the 15 GB hana bin first), how many builds ran at once at each kill and whose they were, and CI's real process memory against its page cache. Then write the admission design in one page, with its numbers and what it changes for CI, for the sessions and for steve. Weigh at least these:
- CI drawing on the same budget as the sessions (steve);
- admitting by a crate's measured peak instead of by slot count;
- a slice for builds only, with MemoryHigh, so builds slow down instead of dying (never app.slice);
- zram in place of or beside the swapfile;
- cutting the 15 GB crate's peak.

Send the design to the showrunner as a `— decision:` for the user. Phase 2 builds what the user approves.

### Phase 2 — One memory admission for every build · status: todo

Build the approved design. A build that has to wait says why and since when, and queues instead of being killed. The wait has a stated limit and never blocks forever. The build log records each wait. Then measure a working day against the target.

### Phase 3 — A build hold releases one session at a time · status: todo

- `/build_hold release` releases sessions one at a time behind Phase 2's admission. If the admission alone staggers them, measure it, say so, and drop the extra step.
- The quiet test before the held test also checks the load average, not only `pgrep`.
- ratio-unit's Phase 2 makes `/build_hold` write a per-holder file in `~/.local/state/build-hold/`. Give it `since`, `for` and `release_eta` rather than adding a second file, and have `dailies_render.py --footer` read it, so a showrunner no longer passes `--build-hold-release` by hand. Whoever lands second on `commands/build_hold.md` resolves the conflict.
