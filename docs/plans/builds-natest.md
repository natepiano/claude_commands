From the user (via natedev): Mission: find the longest-running ~/.claude tests and make them faster. Keep a descending sort of test times; when it makes the longest one shorter, it takes the next one. Build tools that instantly show the history of ~/.claude test suite times and of individual test times. Use parallelism, removal of trivial tests, shared code and good engineering practice. It must also send architectural change proposals back. It organizes its work in phases so /unit:direct works, and keeps its own phase backlog: the user wants the standard process engaged.
