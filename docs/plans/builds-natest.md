# natest

> **Status: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN — phased, direct-ready.** Record each `~/.claude` test run, test module and slow test in the build log, show their history at once with `/test_times`, and make the slowest test modules faster, from the top of a descending sort down.

> **Production: builds** — unit `natest-unit`; production doc `docs/plans/builds-production.md`

## Source

From the user (via natedev): Mission: find the longest-running ~/.claude tests and make them faster. Keep a descending sort of test times; when it makes the longest one shorter, it takes the next one. Build tools that instantly show the history of ~/.claude test suite times and of individual test times. Use parallelism, removal of trivial tests, shared code and good engineering practice. It must also send architectural change proposals back. It organizes its work in phases so /unit:direct works, and keeps its own phase backlog: the user wants the standard process engaged.

## Standing work

1. At each phase start, read the merge gate's slowdown warnings; natest-unit owns them. A warned module goes to `builds-natest-next.md`.
2. At each phase end, re-sort with `show.py top`. Before the last todo phase starts, add a speed phase for the top live module that no phase holds.
3. `builds-natest-next.md` lists each module with a reported floor. A floored module is a target again only when its gate median rises 20% above its floor.
4. When no live module has a median over 60 s, the plan holds and tells the showrunner; it does not close.

## Delegation Context

- **Project:** `~/.claude` — the scripts, commands and config that run the user's productions. This plan records test times and makes the slowest test modules faster.
- **Project started:** 2026-11-03T14:50:07.684+00:00
- **Stack:** Python 3.13, standard library only (`unittest`, `sqlite3`, `json`); Markdown commands; `.conf` files read through `scripts/lib/conf.py`.
- **Layout:**
  - `scripts/test_times/` — new, natest-unit owns it: the module runner, the gate record writer, the `test_times` query tool and their tests
  - `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — the merge gate (owner: sdlc devtools-unit)
  - `scripts/buildlog/` — the build log store and its SQLite index (owner: report-unit)
  - `config/test_times.conf` — new: the tunables of this plan
  - `commands/test_times.md` — new: the `/test_times` command
  - `scripts/<folder>/test_*.py` — the test modules that the speed phases change (natest-unit changes shared test files through cargo-berth's flow; production doc, Units → natest-unit)
- **Key files:**
  - `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — line numbers on builds 772ef96a9: `MODULE_HISTORY_RUNS = 5` (103); `SUITE_BOOTSTRAP` (108, execs its argv); `GateJobResult` (159, has `cpu_seconds`); `gate_state_dir()` (510); `start_gate_job` (638); `test_module_environment` (655, gives each module a private `TMPDIR`, `BUILDLOG_DIR` and tool tripwires); `finish_gate_job` (678, finishes every job, the type job included); `PassedTreeLedger` (736, `CleanTestTree.tree` and `.commit`); `discover_test_modules` (864); `run_suites` (878): the module argv at 1003 is `[*scope_prefix, python, "-m", "unittest", "discover", "-s", str(path.parent), "-p", path.name]`, the type job argv is at 1000-1001, the rerun-alone pass keeps first results in `first_runs`, and the `finally` block (1074-1088) saves `module_seconds.json`, `module_cpu_seconds.json`, `module_peak_mib.json`, `types_peak_mib.json` and `module_history.json`; the summary lines (1093-1127) print each folder suite's time from `suite_started` and `suite_finished` Since Phase 2 (8bc0d5c88): each module job runs `RUNNER` (`scripts/test_times/module_run.py`), not `unittest discover`; `discover_test_modules` (877); `record_gate_run` writes the run record.
  - `scripts/production/merge_gate_test_support.py`, `scripts/production/test_merge_gate*.py` — the gate's fixture and tests
  - `scripts/buildlog/store.py` — `root()` (honors `BUILDLOG_DIR`), `host_name()`, `utc_iso(epoch)`, `host_file(host, epoch)`, `append_line(path, record)`: the JSON-lines store, one file per host per month
  - `scripts/buildlog/record.py` — `RECORD_VERSION`, `new_id(host, epoch)` (513), `ssh_attempt` (1055): the pattern for a one-line record writer
  - `scripts/buildlog/index.py` — `SCHEMA_VERSION = 29` (42); column lists such as `TEST_COLUMNS` (141) and `CALL_COLUMNS`; `TABLES` (452, with the gate tables); `create_schema` (574, adds a `<table>_src` index for each table); `insert`, `pick`; `add_step` (763, the pattern for a nested list that becomes child rows); `ADDERS` (950, `gate_run` maps to `add_gate_run`); `forget` (954, loops `TABLES`); `update()` (1012); `read_only()` (1051)
  - `scripts/test_times/gate_record.py` — the `gate_run` record types (`ModuleTimes`, `ModuleRun`, `SuiteRun`, `GateRun`, `NoModuleTimes`), `TYPE_CHECK_JOB` (38), `read_module_times` (131), `kept_tests` (153), `slow_test_s` (162), `write_gate_run` (166) Since Phase 2: `Execution` (106), `module_runs` (185), `report_not_written` (213), `write_gate_run` (219).
  - `scripts/buildlog/cli.py` — runs `index.update()` before each report (140)
  - `scripts/lib/conf.py` — `read(file).number(key)`; a config file puts a `# range: 0..` or `# whole: 1..` line directly above each `KEY=value` (see `config/mesh_runs.conf`)
  - `config/README.md` — one entry for each config file
  - `scripts/lib/user_zone.py` — `user_zone()`; `scripts/lib/test_user_zone.py` scans every script and fails an `astimezone()` with no zone
  - `scripts/lib/terminal_cells.py` — terminal cell widths for aligned tables
  - `commands/build/status.md` — the form of a command that runs one script and shows its lines unchanged
  - `docs/as-built/merge-gate-and-test-speed.md` — the gate's as-built and its test rules: no live state, no wall-clock thresholds, no fixed waits in the code under test, few process launches, no trivial tests
  - `~/.local/state/merge-gate/module_history.json` — the gate's last 5 wall times for each module, with no times of day; it seeds the first sort only
- **Test lanes:** none as `tests/` folders. Each module's tests sit beside it as `scripts/<folder>/test_<name>.py`; the `test` worker writes those files.
- **Build:** none (Python).
- **Test:** for each named test file, `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/<folder> -p '<file>'` from the worktree root; always also `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/lib`. Checkpoint gate: merge origin's merge branch first, then `env HERDR_BIN=/nonexistent/herdr python3 ~/.claude/scripts/production/merge_gate.py --checkout <tree> --tests-only` (main's copy of the gate).
- **Lint:** `basedpyright <changed Python files>` passes when its output has the `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes` line; the exit status says nothing.
- **Invariants:**
  - Tests use fixtures. They never read or write live state: `~/.claude` main, `~/.local/state/buildlog`, `~/.local/state/merge-gate`, `/tmp/claude` (the gate's as-built).
  - Python is typed throughout, with no `Any` and no file-level type ignores (user, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).
  - All text uses Simplified Technical English (user, 2026-10-18).
  - One place for each thing (user, 2026-10-30): reuse the build log store and index, `conf.py`, `user_zone.py`, `terminal_cells.py` and the gate's `discover_test_modules`; never copy a reader, a parser or a module list.
  - A tunable lives in config and is read at use (user, 2026-10-31).
  - Speed work keeps coverage (user mission, 2026-11-03). Every behavior a module checked before stays checked. A trivial test is removed only with its covering test or its reason named in the phase report. A trivial test asserts a constant, the standard library, or only what another test in the same module already asserts.
  - A speed gain that needs a change outside a phase's Files goes to the showrunner as an architecture proposal with the measured gain; the phase does not make the change (user mission, 2026-11-03). Examples: gate scheduling, the type-check job, the design of production code, a new shared fixture library.
  - A record write never turns a gate red: a failed write prints one line and the gate goes on (this plan's choice).
  - A worker starts at most one detached run at a time, with at most 4 named test files; the wide suites go in one final gate run (sdlc, 2026-11-03). Fix every visible failure before a rerun; after a pass, do not run again until the edits are done (user, 2026-10-31).
  - No test run starts while a natedev build hold is in force (builds showrunner, 2026-11-03).
  - A change to another unit's file names that owner in the checkpoint notice (production doc, Production rules).

- **Speed method** (every speed phase):
  0. Targets: at dispatch, the director takes the top live rows of `test_times top` that no phase holds. When they differ from the modules the phase names, the director rewrites its Goal, Files and acceptance first. `types/basedpyright` is never a target; it goes to its architecture proposal.
  1. Baseline: before the edit, run the module three times with `TEST_TIMES_OUT=<run directory>/<module>-before-<n>-<sha>.json python3 scripts/test_times/module_run.py scripts/<folder> <file>` and keep the median `wall_s` and `cpu_s`. These runs find the cost (step 2); they are not the before number of the gain (step 5). Read `python3 scripts/test_times/show.py module <folder>/<file>` for the gate history.
  2. Find the cost from the JSON: the slowest tests, and `wall_s - tests_s` (import and module or class fixtures). Name the expensive operations before any edit; do not apply a cut the module already has.
  3. Cut it, in this order:
     - Find each fixed wait first: a sleep, a poll count, or a wait that no published state ends. Wait on the event, file, pipe or ready signal the code already gives. A fixed wait often also causes flakes, so a flaky module is a speed target too (fastest-unit, Phases 5i and 6: 64 to 35 s, 58 to 24 s).
     - Remove trivial tests (Invariants above). Run `python3 scripts/test_times/coverage_overlap.py scripts/<folder> <file>` on the module. Compare each candidate's assertions with its covering tests; a candidate whose result a covering test also checks is a trivial test.
     - Share expensive setup: build a seed once in `setUpModule` or `setUpClass` and copy it for each test, as `scripts/build_hold/test_build_hold.py` does.
     - Call code in-process in place of a subprocess when the test does not check the process boundary; keep one process test for each boundary.
     - Split a module whose tests are independent into two or more files, so the gate runs them at the same time. The original file and its new files are one group: compare the group's summed CPU, its test count, and its wall time when its files run at the same time. Every file of the group is in acceptance. Time the group with one `module_run.py` process per file, all started at once (as `pairs.sh` does), from the first start to the last end. The gate runs at most half the CPU count of modules at once (`DEFAULT_MAX_RUNNING_JOBS` in `merge_gate.py`); a group with more files than that gains less in the gate.
  4. A change to a shared support file (for example `scripts/lint/memory_test_support.py`) is allowed only when every module that imports it stays green; name those importers in the final gate run.
  5. After the edit, measure the gain in same-load pairs: run the module at the phase base (a `copies.py run --commit <base>` copy) and in the worktree at the same time, three rounds, into `<module>-pair-<before|after>-<n>-<sha>.json`, with `/proc/loadavg` beside each round. The host load changes all day, so a before batch and a later after batch do not compare. The director runs the pairs after the last repair lands (example: `phases/7/pairs.sh` in the run directory). Half the wall time is the target. When the allowed edits cannot reach it, report the measured floor and send the rest as an architecture proposal. A floor names its cost breakdown and the one operation that limits it. A proposal names its owner, its revisit condition, and whether its gain is measured or estimated. The pair tool prints the before and after medians as a table when it ends. Report the before and after medians, each removed test with its reason or covering test, and each architecture proposal with its measured gain.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — The module runner writes each test's time  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- `scripts/test_times/module_run.py <start_dir> <pattern>` runs one module through `unittest.main` with `TimedRunner`, so its output and exit status match `python -m unittest discover` (1 on a failure, 5 when no test ran, else 0). It uses the standard library only and puts `os.getcwd()` in `sys.path[0]`, so main's copy works by its absolute path on another tree. A wrong argument count prints `usage: module_run.py <start_dir> <pattern>` and exits 2.
- `TimedResult` records each outcome itself: `startTest` and `stopTest` open and close the parent test, `addSubTest` maps a subtest outcome to its parent, and `addDuration` keeps the time. Each parent id has one entry, by precedence `error` > `fail` > `unexpected_success` > `expected_failure` > `skip` > `pass`. A skip has `s` 0.0. A class or module fixture failure has its own `error` entry with its description as `test`.
- `main()` pops `TEST_TIMES_OUT` from the environment before discovery and keeps it in `TimedRunner.destination` (`TimesOutput | NoTimesOutput`). After the run, `write_times` writes `{wall_s, cpu_s, tests_s, tests_run, failures, errors, skipped, tests}` to that path with `os.replace`. `cpu_s` is the process plus its reaped children. A failed write prints `test times not written: <error>` to stderr and keeps the exit status.
- `scripts/test_times/gate_record.py` holds `TestStatus` (a `Literal` of the six statuses), the TypedDicts `TestTime`, `ModuleTimes`, `ModuleRun`, `SuiteRun`, `GateRun` and `GateRunRecord`, and the frozen dataclass `NoModuleTimes(reason)`.
  - `read_module_times(path: Path) -> ModuleTimes | NoModuleTimes` validates the whole file. A missing or invalid file gives `NoModuleTimes("<path>: <error>")`.
  - `kept_tests(times, slow_test_s) -> list[TestTime]` keeps every `fail`, `error` and `unexpected_success` test and every other test with `s >= slow_test_s`, slowest first.
  - `slow_test_s() -> float` reads `SLOW_TEST_S` at each call.
  - `write_gate_run(run: GateRun) -> None` appends `{"kind": "gate_run", "v", "id", "host", **run}` through `scripts/buildlog/store.py` and `scripts/buildlog/record.py`. It catches every error and prints `gate run not written: <error>`.
- `config/test_times.conf` holds `SLOW_TEST_S=0.5` and `TOP_RUNS=5`. `config/README.md` has its entry.

**Files:**
- `scripts/test_times/module_run.py` — the timing module runner
- `scripts/test_times/gate_record.py` — the record types, the times reader, `kept_tests`, `slow_test_s` and `write_gate_run`
- `config/test_times.conf` — `SLOW_TEST_S`, `TOP_RUNS`
- `scripts/test_times/test_module_run.py` — subprocess tests on fixture modules, compared with `python -m unittest discover`
- `scripts/test_times/test_gate_record.py` — reader, threshold and writer tests with `BUILDLOG_DIR` and `CONF_DIR` fixtures

**Binds later work:** The merge gate passes `TEST_TIMES_OUT` in each module job's environment, and the runner reads it once in `main()`. `write_gate_run` catches every error, so its caller adds no catch around it. `NoModuleTimes.reason` is the text the gate records as `times_missing`. `ModuleRun.restart` is empty or `hold`, and `ModuleRun.attempt` counts from 1.

**Gotchas:** Discovery imports the test modules before any test runs, so `TEST_TIMES_OUT` leaves the environment before `unittest.main`, not in `TimedRunner.run`.

**Ruled out:** a `Protocol` `isinstance` check on a subtest's `test_case` attribute — `addSubTest` already receives the parent test.

### Phase 2 — The merge gate records every run  · status: done
**Depends on:** Phase 1

#### As-built

- Each merge gate module job runs `RUNNER` (`scripts/test_times/module_run.py`, the gate checkout's copy) in place of `unittest discover`. `test_module_environment` sets `TEST_TIMES_OUT` to the module root's `test-times.json`, and `finish_gate_job` reads it with `gate_record.read_module_times`. The type-check job reads no file: its times are `TimingNotApplicable`.
- `run_suites` keeps one `gate_record.Execution` per finished job, a hold restart included. `record_gate_run` builds the `GateRun` with `gate_record.module_runs` and calls `write_gate_run` once per gate run.
- An exception after the first job starts writes the record with `aborted: true` (`record_on_abort`, a context manager first in the `run_suites` `with`) and raises again. An aborted record holds only the finished jobs.
- A failed record build prints `gate run not written: <error>` (`report_not_written`). The gate's output, exception and verdict never change.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — the runner argv, the times read, `executions`, `record_gate_run`, `record_on_abort`
- `scripts/test_times/gate_record.py` — `Execution`, `module_runs`, `report_not_written`
- `scripts/production/test_merge_gate_test_times.py` — the record tests

**Binds later work:** module rows: `attempt` counts from 1 per module, `restart` is `hold` or empty, `times_missing` is the `NoModuleTimes` reason and is empty for `ModuleTimes` and the type job. The first live `gate_run` record appears when this code reaches the `~/.claude` main checkout that runs the gates.

**Gotchas:** the record clock uses `datetime.now(UTC)`, because `test_merge_gate_holds.py` replaces `merge_gate.time` with a monotonic-only stub. Any edit to `merge_gate.py` runs every `test_merge_gate*.py` file, `test_merge_gate_holds.py` included.

### Phase 3 — The build log indexes gate runs  · status: done
**Depends on:** Phase 1

#### As-built

- `index.update()` indexes each `gate_run` log line into four tables: `gate_runs` (one row for each run), `gate_suites`, `gate_modules` and `gate_tests`. `add_gate_run` is in `ADDERS`; `forget` removes a source's rows from all four tables.
- Indexes: `gate_modules (suite, module, started_at)` and `gate_tests (suite, module, test, started_at)`. A suite, module or test history query uses them (0.1-0.6 ms over 500 runs). A nested entry that is not a dict is skipped.
- `SCHEMA_VERSION` is 29. The first `update()` after the version change rebuilds the index from the source logs (22.6 s on a copy of the live log).
- `gate_record.TYPE_CHECK_JOB = ("types", "basedpyright")` names the type-check job's (suite, module) pair; the index leaves that row out of `modules_run` and `tests_run`.
- `test_index.py` has a module-level `rows(sql, *parameters)` helper; `test_index_rerun.py` imports it.

**Files:**
- `scripts/buildlog/index.py` — the gate tables, their indexes, `add_gate_run`, `SCHEMA_VERSION = 29`
- `scripts/test_times/gate_record.py` — `TYPE_CHECK_JOB`
- `scripts/buildlog/test_gate_index.py` — gate table rows, rerun without new rows, `forget`, query plans over 500 fixture runs
- `scripts/buildlog/test_index.py` — the schema check follows `index.SCHEMA_VERSION`; the shared `rows` helper
- `scripts/buildlog/test_index_rerun.py` (owner report-unit) — imports the shared `rows` helper

**Binds later work:** the merge gate's type-check job uses `gate_record.TYPE_CHECK_JOB`. `/test_times` reads the four gate tables; a test-name substring match scans `gate_tests` (19 ms over 250,000 rows).

**Gotchas:** `write_gate_run` imports `record` and `store` inside its body: a module-level import makes the cycle index -> gate_record -> record -> memory_admit -> index.

**Ruled out:** a `gate_tests (test)` index — no B-tree serves a substring match; `executemany` for `gate_tests` inserts — saves 2 ms per rebuild and adds a second insert path.

### Phase 4 — `/test_times` shows suite, module and test history  · status: done
**Depends on:** Phase 2, Phase 3

#### As-built

- `scripts/test_times/show.py` has the subcommands `top` (the default), `suites`, `suite <folder>`, `module <folder>/<file>` and `test <text>`. Each subcommand runs `index.update()`, then queries `index.read_only()` for rows of the current host only.
- `top` ranks each live module by the median `wall_s` of its ranking rows from its last `TOP_RUNS` gate runs (`config/test_times.conf`). A ranking row is the lowest `attempt` with an empty `restart`. A module is live when `merge_gate.discover_test_modules(repo)` lists it; `types/basedpyright` is always live and shows empty test cells.
- A row with `times_missing` shows `times missing`, never zero. A test with no kept row in a later run shows `not kept`. A row of an aborted run carries the mark `aborted`; its completed module rows still count in `top`.
- Times show in the user zone as `11-03 09:30`. An empty result prints `no modules recorded yet` (`top`) or `no gate runs recorded yet` and exits 0. `top` answers in 0.73 s with a warm index.
- `store.locked_rows(path, start=0) -> Iterator[dict[str, object]]` opens a build log file, takes a shared flock and yields `whole_rows(handle, start)`; an absent file yields no rows. `record.read_attempt_results` reads through it.
- `terminal_cells.pad_left(text, cells)` and `pad_right(text, cells)` pad by terminal cell width.

**Files:**
- `scripts/test_times/show.py` — the history tool
- `scripts/test_times/test_show.py` — its tests, with one test that loads each gate-discovered module in `scripts/test_times`
- `scripts/test_times/gate_record_test_support.py` — the `gate_run()` and `module_times()` fixtures, shared by `test_gate_record.py`, `scripts/buildlog/test_gate_index.py` and `test_show.py`
- `commands/test_times.md` — `/test_times`: runs `show.py $ARGUMENTS` and shows its lines unchanged
- `scripts/buildlog/store.py` (owner report-unit) — `locked_rows`
- `scripts/buildlog/record.py` (owner report-unit) — `read_attempt_results` calls `locked_rows`
- `scripts/lib/terminal_cells.py` (owner queue-unit) — `pad_left`, `pad_right`

**Binds later work:** a speed phase reads before and after medians with `show.py module <folder>/<file>`. Gate records exist only after the record writer in `merge_gate.py` reaches the main checkout that runs the gates; until then, a speed phase measures its baseline with `module_run.py`. `show.py` imports `discover_test_modules` and `test_module_name` from `merge_gate.py`; "The test history tool starts without the merge gate module" moves them to a light module. `memory_admit.py` and `sweep.py` still keep their own copy of the locked row loop.

**Gotchas:**
- A file named `test_*.py` in a gate suite folder is a test module to the gate; a tool in that folder must not use that name.
- `test_show.py` imports `scripts.lib.test_hang_guard` absolutely, above its `TYPE_CHECKING` block: `scripts/lib/test_one_hang_guard.py` reads that import.
- A tree that changes `scripts/lib/terminal_cells.py` makes the gate run the full suite (36 min at load 50).

**Ruled out:** a `scripts/production/test_modules.py` light module — the name matches the gate's test pattern.

### Phase 5 — The two slowest direct modules run in half their time  · status: done

#### As-built

- The SSH target tests are five `test_verify_ssh_targets*.py` files that share `verify_ssh_targets_test_support.py`. Each file runs in its own `module_run.py` process, all at the same time (the runner itself is serial). Group wall time is 62-71 s (median), from 327.1 s; CPU is 181-188 s, from 205.5 s.
- The assign launcher tests are four `test_assign_launcher*.py` files (`test_assign_launcher.py`, `_identity`, `_reuse`, `_review`) that share `assign_launcher_test_support.py`. Most tests call the launcher in-process; `test_unreadable_staff_starts_no_worker` runs it as a separate process, because the progress recorder writes its refusal to the process stderr.
- The merge gate test-times fixture writes `build_admission.conf` and `build_folders.conf` into its private config folder.
- The build log index is at `SCHEMA_VERSION = 31`. A database at an older schema rebuilds, and the rebuild reads gate history from the start of each log, also before the saved offset.

**Files:**
- `scripts/direct/test_verify_ssh_targets*.py`, `scripts/direct/verify_ssh_targets_test_support.py` — the SSH target group
- `scripts/direct/test_assign_launcher*.py`, `scripts/direct/assign_launcher_test_support.py` — the assign launcher group
- `scripts/buildlog/index.py`, `scripts/buildlog/test_index.py` — schema 31 and the legacy-schema recovery test

**Gotchas:**
- A test fixture that sets its own `CONF_DIR` breaks each time a unit moves a setting into a new config file.
- CPU comparisons are valid only when the before and after runs go one after the other on an idle host.
- A split of a file that other units edit makes later upstream merges need hand ports: merge origin/builds before each split and keep the split window short.
- The index schema number must stay above the builds branch's number; a clash makes one side skip its rebuild.

### Phase 6 — The simplify-lens and assign-launcher modules run faster  · status: done
**Depends on:** Phase 5

#### As-built

- `test_simplify_lens.py` seeds one git repository per class and copies it for each test. `setUp()` still records `start-run` and `start-phase simplify` for each test, except the ad hoc test, where the assignment makes the phase. Same-load pairs: 204 s to 118 s wall, CPU 117 s to 94 s.
- `assign_launcher_test_support.py` defines `AssignmentExecution = InProcessAssignment | LauncherScript`; `AssignLauncherFixture.launch()` and `successful()` take `execution`. The process tests stay.
- The assign launcher group records its session for each test, as before.

**Files:**
- `scripts/direct/test_simplify_lens.py` — per-class git seed
- `scripts/direct/assign_launcher_test_support.py` — named execution choices
- `scripts/direct/test_assign_launcher.py`, `_identity`, `_reuse`, `_review` — use the execution choices
- `scripts/agents/test_heartbeat.py` — checks the wait helper

**Gotchas:**
- The simplify-lens floor is one real review-launcher run per test (3-6 s); `test_report_validation` takes 25 s for 8 launches.
- On natedev, before and after batches at different times compare host load, not code; measure with same-load pairs.

**Ruled out:**
- A per-class recorder seed for the assign launcher tests (F025): it gained about 4%, so simple wins (showrunner ruling).

### Phase 7 — The fast-track module and the next live slow module run in half their time  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- `test_fast_track.py` calls the CLI in-process where a test does not check the process boundary, and starts Git directly where no interruption fixture is needed. Same-load pairs (load 40-73): 304 s to 193 s wall, 202 s to 110 s CPU. Half was not reached; the floor is 55 tests at about 3.5 s each of real Git work. The architecture proposal (one injected Git runner in `fast_track.py`) went to the showrunner.
- The Git hang guard script forks a watcher that moves to its own process group and stops the Git group through `send_process_group`, loaded by path (the script runs with `-S`).
- `cli_fixture.py` adds the `@process_boundary` mark and `process_boundary_for_case()`. The fixtures that kept one named test as a process now read the mark from the test method.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/test_fast_track.py` — speed edits and the hang guard
- `scripts/production/cli_fixture.py` — the process-boundary mark
- `scripts/production/merge_checkpoint_test_support.py`, `rename_test_support.py`, `scripts/direct/findings_test_support.py`, `scripts/bevy_upgrade/cli_test_support.py`, `scripts/style/style_plan_test_support.py` — read the mark; one importer test of each marks its process case

**Gotchas:**
- `lib/test_process_group.py` also scans script text held in strings: a group signal there goes through `send_process_group`, from a process outside the target group.

**Ruled out:**
- A per-class seed for `test_crate_run.py`: no gain under the same load (128 s to 126 s).

### Phase 8 — The test history tool starts without the merge gate module  · status: done

#### As-built

- `scripts/production/gate_modules.py` holds `test_module_name`, `discover_test_modules` and the gate refusal error `GateRefused`. Discovery uses `os.walk`, skips `__pycache__`, and sorts on the path parts, so `merge_gate` keeps its module order. `merge_gate.py`, `show.py` and every `test_merge_gate*.py` module import these names from `gate_modules`.
- `show.py` does not import `merge_gate`, so each `/test_times` command starts about 0.4 s faster.
- `index.GATE_TABLES` is the tuple of gate tables, taken from the `TABLES` keys. `show.py` probes them after `index.update()` and `read_only()`. A missing gate table gives one line that ends "run `buildlog reindex`", exit 1. After the probe, a report query error keeps its traceback.
- `index.update()` makes no `meta` root write when the stored root is the same.

**Files:**
- `scripts/production/gate_modules.py`, `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` — discovery and `GateRefused`
- `scripts/test_times/show.py`, `scripts/test_times/test_show.py` — the light import and the missing-table line
- `scripts/buildlog/index.py`, `scripts/buildlog/test_gate_index.py` — `GATE_TABLES` and the no-write update
- `scripts/production/test_merge_gate*.py` — imports from `gate_modules`

**Gotchas:**
- basedpyright reports a name reached through another module's import as private (`reportPrivateLocalImportUsage`). A moved name moves in every importer in the same phase.

### Phase 9 — Memory admission and the disk sweeper read the build log through the locked reader  · status: done

#### As-built

- `memory_admit.anonymous_history_rows(path)` returns `store.locked_rows(path)`. `sweep.build_log_rows`, `sweep.trim_row_recorded` and `sweep.read_sweep_removals` read through `store.locked_rows`. A month file that the rebuild enumerated and then cannot open still fails the rebuild report.
- `memory_admit.py` imports the buildlog modules under `TYPE_CHECKING`, like `sweep.py`; the hand-copied store protocols are gone. `admission_service.py`, `admission_client.py` and their tests import `store` the same way.
- `memory_admit.current_worktree_steps` keeps its own locked read: it needs the handle under the same lock for `os.fstat` and the file marks, and it raises on a partial tail.
- `queue_lines.py` and `queue_view.py` pad through `scripts/lib/terminal_cells.py`; the padding cases are in `test_terminal_cells.py`.

**Files:**
- `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py`, `scripts/lint/sweep.py` and their tests — the locked reads
- `scripts/build_queue/admission_service.py`, `admission_client.py`, `admission_test_support.py`, `queue_lines.py`, `queue_view.py` and their tests
- `scripts/lib/test_terminal_cells.py` — the padding cases

**Gotchas:**
- Reading `cgroup.procs` of a cgroup the kernel is removing gives ENODEV, not `FileNotFoundError`. `reservation_lifetime` catches only `FileNotFoundError`; resources-unit owns the fix.

### Phase 10 — Each schema keeps its own build log index file  · status: done

#### As-built

- The index file is `index-<sha256>.sqlite` in the store root. The hash covers `SCHEMA_VERSION` and every schema statement (tables, columns, indexes), so a tree with another schema opens its own file and rebuilds nothing of a peer's.
- `index.index_path()` names the file in `store.root()`; `index.index_path_in(root)` names it in a given root; `index.read_only_uri(root)` gives the quoted read-only URI. Every reader calls one of these. `store.INDEX_NAME` is gone.
- `index.update()` rebuilds when any `TABLES` name is missing, and sets the current file's mtime when it is more than one day old. `cleanup_unused_indexes` deletes another schema's file only when `max(st_atime, st_mtime)` is older than `INDEX_UNUSED_DAYS` from `config/buildlog.conf` (30).
- `store.locked_rows` reads the bytes under the shared lock, releases it, then decodes and yields the rows.
- A dropped gate table is rebuilt by `update()`. `show.py` keeps the one-line missing-table diagnostic for a table still missing after `update()`.

**Files:**
- `scripts/buildlog/index.py`, `scripts/buildlog/store.py`, `config/buildlog.conf` — file name, rebuild, cleanup, lock span
- `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py`, `scripts/buildlog/width_trial.py`, `scripts/hierarchies/measure.py`, `scripts/test_times/show.py` — readers
- `scripts/buildlog/test_index.py`, `test_gate_index.py`, `test_store.py`, `scripts/test_times/test_show.py` and the tests that build the index path

**Binds later work:**
- No code names `index.sqlite`; a new reader calls `index.index_path()` or `index.index_path_in(root)`.

**Gotchas:**
- `hashlib` and the schema statements add about 2 ms to each CLI start that imports `index`.

**Ruled out:**
- Cost indexes outside the hash: a changed cost index is a schema change and gets its own file.

### Phase 11 — Shared test fixtures skip repeated setup  · status: done
**Depends on:** Phase 6

#### As-built

- No change shipped. Same-load pairs (3 rounds) showed no gain: `test_simplify_lens` 93.2 to 92.7 s wall, `test_nix_env` 3.0 to 2.8 s, `test_nix_env_launches` 4.7 to 4.7 s, `test_review_launcher` 32.2 to 32.5 s.

**Gotchas:**
- The `lib/py` interpreter probe is not a measurable share of these modules. Their cost is git work and subprocess starts.

**Ruled out:**
- Fixture micro-cuts (an interpreter cache seed, a per-class config copy): the gain is noise, and a trimmed config copy needs a hand-kept file list that breaks a future caller.

### Phase 12 — A tool lists the tests that only repeat other tests  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

**Result:** `coverage_overlap.py` on `test_fast_track.py`: 25 of 55 tests known, 9 candidates, 191 s with the collector on (189 s module time). The 30 unknown tests name their cause (a git wrapper script on the test PATH, or Python children with no set). Thread attribution, setup-child liveness and a failed exec moved to Phase 15; Phase 13 waits for it.

#### As-built

- `python3 scripts/test_times/coverage_overlap.py scripts/<folder> <file> [<file> ...]` runs the modules through `unittest` with `sys.monitoring` `LINE` events under its own tool id, one `(path, line)` set for each test. `COVERAGE_OUT=<path>` writes the JSON (tree sha, interpreter, and for each test: id, status, seconds, line count, `child`, covering ids). The table prints through `terminal_cells.print_table` and `seconds`.
- Candidates are decided slowest first against the kept set; two tests that cover each other give one candidate. Unknown tests are never candidates and cover nothing.
- `line_collector.py` holds the `LINE` collector, the path filter and the launch record (audit hook), used by the parent and by each child. `start_child()` owns the child setup. `ActiveTest.finish_processes()` drops a `Popen` with no pid, records exited and pending launches, and releases the `Popen` objects; `stop_test` and `write_child_report` both call it. A thread-local argument identity skips the duplicate `posix_spawn` event.
- `coverage_child/sitecustomize.py` loads `line_collector.start_child()` when `NATEST_COVERAGE_TEST` is set, then always loads the next `sitecustomize` (the Nix `NIX_PYTHONPATH` one).
- The child rule is a count: `unknown: <n> python children, <m> reported` when a Python child wrote no set (this covers `-I`, `-S`, `-E`), `unknown: unverified launch <program>` for a shell, `env` or a non-Python `#!` script. `COVERAGE_LEAF_PROGRAMS` (`git`) launches are verified. A launch that fails to start is no launch.
- The path filter drops test code (`scripts.lib.code_kind.is_test_code`), the runner classes (the files of `CoverageResult.__mro__`) and the collector.
- `module_run.timed_outcomes(result)` is the one outcome rule for `test_times` and the collector. `print_table` and `seconds` moved from `show.py` to `scripts/lib/terminal_cells.py`.
- On `test_fast_track.py`: 25 of 55 known, 9 candidates, 191 s with the collector on (189 s module time). 28 of the unknown tests cite `unverified launch git`: the module puts a non-Python `#!` git wrapper on PATH.

**Files:**
- `scripts/test_times/coverage_overlap.py`, `line_collector.py`, `coverage_child/sitecustomize.py` — the tool
- `scripts/test_times/module_run.py`, `show.py`, `scripts/lib/terminal_cells.py` — the shared outcome rule and table
- `scripts/test_times/test_coverage_overlap.py` — 22 tests, 4 s

**Gotchas:**
- A commit during a simplify review changes git status, and the review fails. Commit nothing while a reviewer runs.
- Each review round found new attribution edges. Thread attribution, setup-child liveness and a failed exec moved to Phase 15 at repair round 3 (hard landing, after an Astra review).

**Ruled out:**
- coverage.py: the Nix Python does not have it (showrunner ruling 2026-11-04).
- Parsing `-I`/`-S`/`-E` flags: the count rule covers them with no parser.

### Phase 13 — The slowest modules lose the tests that only repeat other tests  · status: done
**Depends on:** Phase 12, Phase 7, Phase 14, Phase 15

#### As-built

- No test was removed. Two workers read each candidate's assertions against those of its covering tests. None checked the same result.
- `scripts/direct/test_verify_ssh_targets_routing.py`, `_results.py`, `_retry.py`: 25 tests, 24 unknown (unverified launches of bash, git, rustc, ssh, rsync, ps; forks; one shared thread), 0 candidates.
- `scripts/aws_target/test_deploy.py`: 97 tests, 39 candidates kept, 4 unknown (bash, env launches).
- `scripts/hana_shot/test_hana_shot.py`: 113 tests, 42 candidates kept, 22 unknown (magick launches, shared threads, a thread that outlived its test, an unreported Python child).
- The five modules held back by the showrunner (other units' unlanded branches) were not read.

**Files:**
- none changed; `scripts/test_times/coverage_overlap.py` was run on the five modules above

**Binds later work:**
- Line overlap does not prove a repeat in a process-heavy module. Speed work on the slowest modules targets process starts and fixed waits.
- Speed proposals sent to the showrunner: the hana_shot fixture server stop (0.5 s `serve_forever` poll, upper bound 47.5 s of 74 s); the hana_shot busy-capture deadline (2.7 s); fake AWS process starts in `test_deploy.py` (three tests near 13 s).

**Gotchas:**
- `test_held_local_target_does_not_block_linux_check` fails under the collector: its fixture mocks `subprocess.Popen`, and `line_collector.py` checks `isinstance` against it. Phase 19 owns the fix.

### Phase 14 — `test_times top` ranks only valid runs  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- `show.py top` counts a module row only when its status is 0, its run is not aborted, its run's checkout is `TOP_CHECKOUT`, and it started within `TOP_MAX_AGE_DAYS`. It keeps the host and `restart = ''` filters. One line under the table names each live module (`discover_test_modules`) that has no counted row. `top` prints in 0.2 s on the live index.
- Each gate run record stores `slow_test_s` and `tests_run`. `gate_record.module_runs(executions, slow_test_s)` takes the threshold; `merge_gate.record_gate_run` reads `gate_record.slow_test_s()` once, inside its `try`, and passes it in. The build log index has both columns in `gate_runs`; an old record reads them as null.
- `show.py suites` prints `tests run`. A test row that is not kept reads `not kept (faster than <slow_test_s> s or did not run)`: a record does not list the tests that ran.

**Files:**
- `scripts/test_times/show.py`, `config/test_times.conf` — ranking filters, the unmeasured line, `TOP_CHECKOUT`, `TOP_MAX_AGE_DAYS`, and `COVERAGE_LEAF_PROGRAMS` for Phase 12
- `scripts/test_times/gate_record.py`, `scripts/buildlog/index.py`, `scripts/production/merge_gate.py` (owner: sdlc devtools-unit) — the two run fields
- `scripts/test_times/test_show.py`, `test_gate_record.py`, `gate_record_test_support.py`, `scripts/buildlog/test_gate_index.py`, `test_index.py` — tests

**Gotchas:**
- A file in the `files` list of two open phases blocks the edit hook. Give each file to one phase when the plan is written.

### Phase 15 — The coverage tool checks which children and threads are alive at each test boundary  · status: done
**Depends on:** Phase 12

#### As-built

- `line_collector.py` keeps each launch's `Popen`, launch kind, owner test and launching thread, and records constructor success explicitly. At each test start and stop it polls the children it holds.
- `coverage_overlap.py` marks a test unknown and names the cause:
  - `child outlived its test`: a test's child is alive at its stop; each later test that starts while it lives is also unknown.
  - `shared child`: a setup Python child is alive at a test's start.
  - `shared thread`: a thread alive at a test's start runs a measured line, or a child is launched from a thread other than the runner thread.
  - `thread outlived its test`: a thread the test started is alive at its stop.
  - `unverified launch git`: a launch with no `Popen` and no set.
- LINE events stay on while thread attribution is needed. A shared thread's line never goes into a test's set.
- An exec writes the set apart from the collector stop. A successful exec keeps the pre-exec set as its own report; a failed exec keeps collection on.
- Acceptance on `test_fast_track.py`: 25 of 55 tests known, 9 candidates. Collector run 229.3 s against 215.2 s plain (ratio 1.07).

**Files:**
- `scripts/test_times/line_collector.py`, `scripts/test_times/coverage_overlap.py` — liveness, threads, exec report
- `scripts/test_times/test_coverage_overlap.py` — tests

**Binds later work:**
- An unknown test is never a removal candidate.

**Gotchas:**
- 28 of 55 `test_fast_track.py` tests stay unknown through `unverified launch git`.
- The checkpoint also carries the Phase 17 fixture repair: `test_target_report.py` and `test_show.py` write a private `buildlog.conf`, which `update()` reads.

### Phase 16 — `/test_times top` ranks the slow tests of the calling session's repository  · status: done
**Depends on:** none

#### As-built

- `show.py top` with no `--repo` takes the root from `treekey.worktree`, then the identity from `record.recorded_repository_key`. The ~/.claude repository keeps the gate module view. Any other repository ranks its nextest tests for one host (`--host`, default `store.host_name()`).
- Rank: one row per `binary` and `test`, keyed `(not passed, -median, binary, test)`. A test with no recorded duration shows `DurationNotRecorded`. The heading names the repository, the host and the threshold.
- `parse.py` reads `NEXTEST_SLOW_TEST_S` (1.0) from `config/test_times.conf` through `nextest_slow_test_s()`.
- `index.py`: the step owns the identity. `tests.repo_identity`, `tests_step` and `tests_repository_history` are gone. `steps.identity_derived` marks a derived identity. `resolve_mac_repositories(connection, touched_calls)` runs one `UPDATE ... INDEXED BY steps_call` for the calls that the update read: it takes the identity of a recorded step of the same call and `repo_path`, else of the call's `ssh_attempts` row. `open_for_update` recreates missing indexes; `update_in(root)` and `update_lock_in(root)` serve a scratch root.
- `width_trial.report` builds a missing index through `update_in`.
- Measured: a 1,939-test hana log keeps 606 rows; `test_results` 11.0 ms plus 7.2 ms insert per step. One Mac step update 33 ms, resolver 0.30 ms. Warm hana top 0.25 s on 1.8 M rows (was 1.6 s). Importing `record` costs 49.7 ms cold in `show.py`.

**Files:**
- `scripts/test_times/show.py`, `scripts/test_times/test_show.py` — scope, host and ranking
- `scripts/buildlog/index.py`, `scripts/buildlog/test_index.py` — derived identity, query indexes
- `scripts/buildlog/parse.py`, `scripts/buildlog/test_parse.py` — the threshold read
- `scripts/buildlog/width_trial.py`, `scripts/buildlog/test_width_trial.py` — missing index build
- `config/test_times.conf`, `config/README.md`, `commands/test_times.md` — key and docs

**Binds later work:**
- Keep the derived-identity rule for old rows. A step with a recorded identity has `identity_derived = 0`, and the resolver never changes it.
- A query that looks up steps by call uses `INDEXED BY steps_call`.

**Gotchas:**
- A correlated identity lookup per call planned through `steps_host_started` and held the live `index.lock` for 5 s and more. The resolver now reads only touched calls.

### Phase 17 — The build log keeps only the index files that a checkout used in the last day  · status: done

#### As-built

- `cleanup_unused_indexes(root, current, settings)` runs at the end of each `update()`, under `update_lock()`. It deletes the legacy `index.sqlite` (`LEGACY_INDEX_NAME`) at any age, and each other `index-<hash>.sqlite` whose `max(st_atime, st_mtime)` is older than `INDEX_UNUSED_DAYS` (2). The current file always stays.
- `update()` reads `config/buildlog.conf` once and sets the current file's mtime when it is older than `INDEX_TOUCH_MINUTES` (60).
- `remove_index(path)` deletes the `INDEX_SIDECAR_SUFFIXES` files (`-journal`, `-wal`, `-shm`) first and the main file last. Cleanup, `reindex()` and `open_for_update()` use it. Cleanup also deletes orphan sidecars, so the next `update()` finishes an interrupted removal.
- A removed file costs its next reader one rebuild. Report commands rebuild through `update()`; memory admission uses its fallback while the index is absent.

**Files:**
- `scripts/buildlog/index.py` — `remove_index`, `INDEX_SIDECAR_SUFFIXES`, `LEGACY_INDEX_NAME`, cleanup, the hourly stamp
- `config/buildlog.conf` — `INDEX_UNUSED_DAYS=2`, `INDEX_TOUCH_MINUTES=60`
- `scripts/buildlog/test_index.py` — cleanup, sidecar, legacy, age and stamp tests

**Binds later work:**
- A change to `index.py` keeps `remove_index()`, `LEGACY_INDEX_NAME`, the `settings` argument of `cleanup_unused_indexes`, and the hourly stamp in `update()`.

**Gotchas:**
- Read-only paths (`index.read_only()`, the four `read_only_uri()` connects in `scripts/lint/memory_admit.py`) never stamp mtime, and relatime moves atime at most once a day. Keep `INDEX_UNUSED_DAYS` at 2 or more and `INDEX_TOUCH_MINUTES` well below it.
- One full rebuild costs 61 s wall, 43 s CPU, 1.0 GB peak memory and a 1.5 GB file (natedev, 2026-11-04).
- A live `show.py top` can hold `index.lock` for a long time; a test or acceptance run uses a scratch `BUILDLOG_DIR` and a timeout.

**Ruled out:**
- A 1-day window: a checkout that only reads its index could lose a file it uses each hour.

### Phase 18 — Mac and Linux mirror steps record the repository identity that natedev sends  · status: todo
**Depends on:** Phase 16

#### Work Order

**Goal:** A new Mac or Linux mirror step records the repository identity of its natedev source checkout, so the index does not need to derive it.

**Spec:** The builds showrunner accepted this architecture proposal from the Phase 16 review on 2026-11-04. This unit owns it. Edits to other units' files are allowed: `scripts/mac_test/offload.py` and `scripts/mac_test/linux_runner.py` (verify-unit), `scripts/buildlog/record.py` (report-unit).

1. Send: the natedev side computes the repository key of the source checkout with `record.recorded_repository_key` (no copy). It passes the key as `BUILDLOG_REPO_IDENTITY` in the mirror command, beside `BUILDLOG_CALL_ID` and `BUILDLOG_SENT_TREE_KEY`: in `offload.py` (the ssh command, about line 1500) and in `linux_runner.py` (the `environment` mapping, about line 720). An `unknown` key is not sent.
2. Record: in `record.py` `step()`, when `recorded_repository_key` gives `store.UNKNOWN_IDENTITY` for a mirror caller (`verify-mac`, `verify-linux`) and `BUILDLOG_REPO_IDENTITY` is set, record that value. Read it through one typed reader beside `sent_tree_key()`. A known local key always wins.
3. Index: keep the Phase 16 index rule for old rows. A step with a recorded identity has `identity_derived = 0`, so the resolver never changes it.
4. The Mac gets the new `record.py` through the normal main promotion. Until then, Mac rows stay `unknown` and the index rule resolves them.
5. Split `repository_key(directory)` out of `record.recorded_repository_key`. Callers that only need the key of a directory call it directly. Remove the `["git"]` argument vector that exists only to pass the empty-argv check (`record.py` about line 541, `show.py` top, four test call sites).
6. Import `conf` under one module name in `parse.py` and `record.sync_config`. Today one step process loads `conf.py` twice (+1.8 ms).
7. Move `recorded_repository_key`, `repository_key` and `remote_identity` into one light module that does not import the rest of `record.py`. `show.py` imports it in place of `record` (importing `record` costs 49.7 ms cold). Measure the cold `show.py` import cost before and after, with the same load.

**Files:**
- `scripts/mac_test/offload.py`, `scripts/mac_test/linux_runner.py` — send the key (verify-unit's files)
- `scripts/buildlog/record.py` — record the sent key (report-unit's file)
- `scripts/buildlog/parse.py` — one `conf` import name (report-unit's file)
- `scripts/buildlog/repository.py` — the new light module for the repository key
- `scripts/test_times/show.py` — import the light module
- `scripts/mac_test/test_offload.py`, `scripts/mac_test/test_linux_runner.py`, `scripts/buildlog/test_record.py`, `scripts/buildlog/test_parse.py`, `scripts/test_times/test_show.py` — the regression tests

**Workers:** 1 writer + 1 tester
- `impl` — `offload.py`, `linux_runner.py`, `record.py`, `parse.py`, `repository.py`, `show.py`
- `test` — the tests: a mirror step with no origin records the identity sent from natedev; a known local key wins over a sent key; the Mac ssh command and the Linux environment carry the key, and omit it when it is unknown; `repository_key` of a directory with and without an origin; one step process loads `conf.py` once

**Constraints from prior phases:**
- Phase 16: the index derives the identity of an `unknown` step from its call and marks it `identity_derived = 1`. Keep that rule for old rows.
- Before work starts, read the open verify-unit and report-unit branches for edits to these three files. Claim the outside files on the berth board, and name them in the notice's also-touches line.
- report-unit Phase 20 (`be35f2d2b`) changes `record.py` `step()`. Never merge report's unlanded branch. Start the `record.py` edits only after report Phase 20 is merged into builds; then merge origin/builds. Until then, work only on `offload.py`, `linux_runner.py` and their tests (showrunner, 2026-11-04).
- Items 5-7 came from the Phase 16 review. The showrunner put them in this phase on 2026-11-04. They also wait for report Phase 20 on builds. Test `parse.py` against report's tip and name it in also-touches.

**Acceptance gate:**
- the changed test modules green on a tree with origin/builds merged after report Phase 20 lands
- a mirror step test records the identity sent from natedev
- the cold `show.py` import time before and after item 7, measured in same-load pairs, in the checkpoint notice
- `basedpyright` on each changed file prints `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes`

### Phase 19 — The coverage tool runs under a mocked `subprocess.Popen` and its git child test passes at high load  · status: todo
**Depends on:** none

#### Work Order

**Goal:** `coverage_overlap.py` collects a module whose fixture replaces `subprocess.Popen` with a mock, and `test_git_child_keeps_coverage_known` passes at load 60.

**Spec:** Both defects are in this unit's own Phase 15 code. The showrunner ruled the flaky test a bounded fix after Phase 13 (2026-11-04).

1. Mocked Popen: `line_collector.py` checks `isinstance(process, subprocess.Popen)` at the time of the call (`stack_popen`, about line 150, and the audit hook, about line 226). A fixture that sets `subprocess.Popen` to a mock makes the second argument a non-type, and the test fails with `TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type`. Seen on `scripts/direct/test_verify_ssh_targets_routing.py` `test_held_local_target_does_not_block_linux_check` (fixture `verify_mac_offload_test_support.py` about line 980). Keep the real class at import, beside `POPEN_INIT`, and check against it.
2. Flaky test: `test_coverage_overlap.py` `test_git_child_keeps_coverage_known` failed once at load 60 and passed on rerun; 0 of 25 repeats failed at load 54. Find the cause from the failure text. Fix the cause in the collector or the fixture; do not add a retry or a longer wait.

**Files:**
- `scripts/test_times/line_collector.py` — the Popen class kept at import
- `scripts/test_times/coverage_overlap.py` — only if the flaky cause is there
- `scripts/test_times/test_coverage_overlap.py` — a regression test with a mocked `subprocess.Popen`; the flaky test fix

**Workers:** 1 writer + 1 tester
- `impl` — `line_collector.py`, `coverage_overlap.py`
- `test` — `test_coverage_overlap.py`: a fixture module that patches `subprocess.Popen` with a mock collects without an error; the git child test under parallel load

**Constraints from prior phases:**
- Phase 15: an unknown test names its cause and is never a removal candidate. Keep every cause and its tests.
- Phase 13: the five slowest modules gave no removal (see its As-built). Most of their tests are unknown through unverified launches of bash, git, rustc, ssh and rsync.

**Acceptance gate:**
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/test_times -p 'test_coverage_overlap.py'` green
- `python3 scripts/test_times/coverage_overlap.py scripts/direct test_verify_ssh_targets_routing.py` runs all 13 tests with no collector error
- the git child test passes 25 of 25 repeats at a load of 55 or more
- `basedpyright` on each changed file prints `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes`
