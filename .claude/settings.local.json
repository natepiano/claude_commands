This improves workflow efficiency by:\n1. Leveraging specialized git expertise for commit analysis and message generation\n2. Maintaining consistent conventional commit formatting across the project\n3. Reducing the burden on the main workflow orchestrator by distributing responsibilities\n4. Enabling directories (.claude/ and agents/) that support the multi-agent workflow to be tracked in version control\n\nRELATED:\nImplements git-agent delegation pattern for commit workflow automation\nEOF\n)\")",
